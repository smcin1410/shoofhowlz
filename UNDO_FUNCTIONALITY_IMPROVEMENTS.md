# Undo Last Pick Functionality - Comprehensive Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Undo Last Pick functionality in the Fantasy Football Draft application. The goal was to ensure the undo feature works correctly, reliably, and provides a good user experience for commissioners.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Undo Implementations**
- **Issue**: Two undo buttons existed - one in `AdminPanel.jsx` (working) and one in `Header.jsx` (not implemented)
- **Fix**: Implemented working undo functionality in `Header.jsx` to match `AdminPanel.jsx`

### 2. **Limited Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Basic error handling with limited validation
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive validation and user-friendly error messages

### 3. **Potential Race Conditions**
- **Issue**: Undo logic didn't handle edge cases properly
- **Fix**: Added extensive validation for draft state, pick history, and current pick position

### 4. **Missing User Feedback**
- **Issue**: No success notifications or visual feedback
- **Fix**: Added success notifications and visual indicators

## Implementation Details

### Server-Side Improvements (`server/index.js`)

#### Enhanced Validation
```javascript
// Validate draft state
if (!draftState.isDraftStarted) {
  socket.emit('draft-error', { message: 'Draft must be started to undo picks' });
  return;
}

if (draftState.isComplete) {
  socket.emit('draft-error', { message: 'Cannot undo picks in a completed draft' });
  return;
}

// Validate current pick state
if (draftState.currentPick <= 0) {
  socket.emit('draft-error', { message: 'Cannot undo beyond the first pick' });
  return;
}
```

#### Anti-Abuse Protection
```javascript
// Check undo cooldown (prevent spam)
const now = Date.now();
if (draftState.lastUndoTime && (now - draftState.lastUndoTime) < 2000) {
  socket.emit('draft-error', { message: 'Please wait 2 seconds between undo operations' });
  return;
}

// Check for too many consecutive undos
if (draftState.undoHistory && draftState.undoHistory.length >= 5) {
  const recentUndos = draftState.undoHistory.filter(undo => (now - undo.timestamp) < 60000);
  if (recentUndos.length >= 5) {
    socket.emit('draft-error', { message: 'Too many undo operations. Please wait before trying again.' });
    return;
  }
}
```

#### Improved Player Reinsertion
```javascript
// Ensure proper sorting by rank with secondary sort by name for equal ranks
draftState.availablePlayers.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.rank !== b.rank) {
    return a.rank - b.rank;
  }
  // Secondary sort by name if ranks are equal
  return a.player_name.localeCompare(b.player_name);
});
```

#### Timer Reset Logic
```javascript
// Reset timer if it's running (give the team time to make their pick again)
if (draftState.timeRemaining > 0) {
  draftState.timeRemaining = draftState.timeClock * 60; // Reset to full time
}
```

#### Undo History Tracking
```javascript
// Track undo operation
draftState.lastUndoTime = Date.now();

// Initialize undo history if not exists
if (!draftState.undoHistory) {
  draftState.undoHistory = [];
}

// Add to undo history (keep last 10 undos)
draftState.undoHistory.push({
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  player: player.player_name,
  position: player.position,
  team: team.name,
  pickNumber: draftState.currentPick + 1
});

if (draftState.undoHistory.length > 10) {
  draftState.undoHistory.shift(); // Remove oldest undo
}
```

### Client-Side Improvements
