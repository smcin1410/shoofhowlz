# Draft Deletion Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The user reported that drafts deleted by an ADMIN account in the dashboard kept reappearing after deletion. This was happening because:

1. **Client-side only deletion**: The `handleDeleteDraft` function in `Dashboard.jsx` only removed drafts from localStorage and local state
2. **Server-side persistence**: The server loads drafts from `drafts.json` on startup and stores them in the `activeDrafts` Map
3. **Missing server communication**: There was no server endpoint to actually delete drafts from the server's memory and persistent storage
4. **Reappearing drafts**: When the client refreshed or the server restarted, drafts were reloaded from the server, causing deleted drafts to reappear

## Root Cause Analysis

### Client-Side Issue
```javascript
// OLD CODE - Only local deletion
const handleDeleteDraft = (draftId, draftName) => {
  if (window.confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete "${draftName}"? This cannot be undone.`)) {
    const updatedDrafts = drafts.filter(d => d.id !== draftId);
    setDrafts(updatedDrafts);
    localStorage.setItem('drafts', JSON.stringify(updatedDrafts));
  }
};
```

### Server-Side Issue
- No DELETE endpoint for drafts
- No cleanup of server-side data structures
- No persistence of deletion to `drafts.json` file

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server-Side DELETE Endpoint

Added a new REST endpoint in `server/index.js`:

```javascript
// Delete a draft
app.delete('/api/drafts/:draftId', (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { draftId } = req.params;
    const { userId, isAdmin } = req.body;
    
    // Check if draft exists
    const draftState = activeDrafts.get(draftId);
    if (!draftState) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Draft not found' });
    }
    
    // Check permissions - only draft creator or admin can delete
    const canDelete = isAdmin || draftState.createdBy === userId;
    if (!canDelete) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Not authorized to delete this draft' });
    }
    
    // Clean up all draft resources
    // - Clear timers
    // - Remove from all tracking maps
    // - Clear user sessions
    // - Save updated drafts to file
    // - Notify all connected clients
    
    res.json({ success: true, message: 'Draft deleted successfully' });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to delete draft' });
  }
});
```

### 2. Enhanced Client-Side Deletion

Updated `handleDeleteDraft` in `Dashboard.jsx`:

```javascript
const handleDeleteDraft = async (draftId, draftName) => {
  if (window.confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete "${draftName}"? This cannot be undone.`)) {
    try {
      // Call server to delete the draft
      const response = await fetch(`${SERVER_URL}/api/drafts/${draftId}`, {
        method: 'DELETE',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          userId: user.id,
          isAdmin: user.isAdmin
        })
      });

      if (response.ok) {
        // Remove from local state and localStorage
        const updatedDrafts = drafts.filter(d => d.id !== draftId);
        setDrafts(updatedDrafts);
        
        const savedDrafts = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('drafts') || '[]');
        const updatedSavedDrafts = savedDrafts.filter(d => d.id !== draftId);
        localStorage.setItem('drafts', JSON.stringify(updatedSavedDrafts));
      } else {
        const errorData = await response.json();
        alert(`Failed to delete draft: ${errorData.error}`);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      alert('Failed to delete draft. Please try again.');
    }
  }
};
```

### 3. Real-Time Updates

Added socket listener for `draft-deleted` events:

```javascript
const handleDraftDeleted = (data) => {
  if (data.draftId) {
    setDrafts(prevDrafts => prevDrafts.filter(d => d.id !== data.draftId));
    
    // Also remove from localStorage
    const savedDrafts = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('drafts') || '[]');
    const updatedSavedDrafts = savedDrafts.filter(d => d.id !== data.draftId);
    localStorage.setItem('drafts', JSON.stringify(updatedSavedDrafts));
  }
};

socket.on('draft-deleted', handleDraftDeleted);
```

## Key Features of the Fix

### 1. **Proper Authorization**
- Only draft creators or admin users can delete drafts
- Server validates permissions before allowing deletion

### 2. **Complete Resource Cleanup**
- Clears all timers associated with the draft
- Removes from all server-side tracking maps:
  - `activeDrafts`
  - `draftParticipants`
  - `draftChatHistory`
  - `draftTeamAssignments`
- Clears user sessions for the deleted draft
- Updates persistent storage (`drafts.json`)

### 3. **Real-Time Synchronization**
- Server broadcasts `draft-deleted` event to all connected clients
- Clients automatically update their UI when drafts are deleted by other users
- Prevents stale data across multiple browser tabs/windows

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Proper HTTP status codes (404, 403, 500)
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallback if server communication fails

### 5. **Persistence**
- Deleted drafts are permanently removed from `drafts.json`
- Survives server restarts
- No reappearing drafts after server restart

## Testing

Created `test_draft_deletion.js` to verify:
- Server-side deletion endpoint works correctly
- Authorization prevents unauthorized deletions
- Client-side deletion properly communicates with server
- Real-time updates work across multiple clients
- Server-side cleanup removes all associated resources

## Files Modified

1. **`server/index.js`**
   - Added DELETE `/api/drafts/:draftId` endpoint
   - Comprehensive resource cleanup logic
   - Real-time event broadcasting

2. **`client/src/components/Dashboard.jsx`**
   - Updated `handleDeleteDraft` to use server endpoint
   - Added socket listener for `draft-deleted` events
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback

3. **`test_draft_deletion.js`** (New)
   - Comprehensive test suite for deletion functionality

## Result

✅ **Drafts deleted by ADMIN accounts now stay deleted permanently**
✅ **No more reappearing drafts after page refresh or server restart**
✅ **Real-time synchronization across all connected clients**
✅ **Proper authorization and error handling**
✅ **Complete cleanup of server resources**

The fix ensures that when an ADMIN (or any authorized user) deletes a draft, it is permanently removed from both the server's memory and persistent storage, preventing it from reappearing when the page is refreshed or the server is restarted.
