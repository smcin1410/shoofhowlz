He paced this rookie class in aDOT (11.1), YPA (10.8) and efficiency rating (181) last season despite dealing with a class-high 5.8% drop rate. Dart is a factor with his legs, as his 9.6% scramble rate ranked second last season and he ran for 2,009 yards in 45 collegiate games. His rushing ability could eventually help him to fantasy relevance, but he is expected to open his career behind Russell Wilson and perhaps Jameis Winston. Dart should only be drafted in superflex, though he'll be worth an add in all formats if promoted to starter."

Pickett showed some rushing ability as a rookie (55-237-3), but followed with a 42-54-1 line in 2023. He will compete with Joe Flacco and rookies Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel for the Browns' starting job, but even if called on to play, Pickett is a long shot to make a leap to fantasy relevance.

He was way more aggressive during multiyear stints at Oklahoma and UCF, and his overall collegiate efficiency is terrific, including QB rating (class-best 161) and QBR (78.8). He's an older prospect and undersized, but adds some value with his legs (career 311-1,895-33 line).

Bowers actually played a pretty healthy share of the snaps (63%, including 74% from Week 14 on) last season, but he was targeted more than four times in only one of 11 games, which also marked his only game over 6.1 fantasy points. The 24-year-old may someday emerge into a fantasy star, but his receiving numbers will be severely limited as long as he's playing alongside Bowers. He should only be rostered in dynasty."

The team likely still views Sinnott as its tight end of the future, but he's not the tight end of the present, as Ertz was signed to an extension during the offseason and Bates is also back. Perhaps the 22-year-old can overtake Ertz at some point this season, but that's not enough incentive to roster him anywhere except in dynasty leagues."

The veteran quarterback entered the 2024 season with high expectations after he had finished his prior six full seasons in the top 10 in pass TDs, as well as seven of his prior nine full seasons in the top 12 in fantasy points per game. Instead, he finished 30th in QBR, paced the NFL with 16 INTs and continued to add nothing with his legs (zero yards on 23 carries). Cousins managed three weekly finishes better than 15th prior to being benched for Michael Penix Jr. in Week 16. Perhaps Cousins will bounce back now that he's more than one year removed from Achilles surgery, but considering he's now 37 years old, it's unlikely he'll find his way back into the QB1 mix."

There are accuracy concerns, but he has a good arm and terrific speed and agility, having posted elite rushing numbers last season (145-906-20). Milroe could eventually find his way to fantasy relevance, but he'll begin his career as a clear backup to Sam Darnold."

That was despite Kincaid missing three games (Knox averaged 5.7 PPG those weeks). In total, Knox had zero double-digit fantasy outings in 2024 and his last game over 10.2 points was Week 16 of 2022.

He had two games with double-digit targets but three with zero. The 26-year-old's fantasy stock took a massive hit in April when Chicago spent its first-round pick on Colston Loveland.

Of course, after backing up Aaron Rodgers last season, Taylor will serve the same role behind newcomer Justin Fields in 2025. Taylor only attempted 22 passes last season and has averaged 68.7 attempts per season since 2018, maxing out with 180 in 2023. Taylor still adds a little bit of value with his legs and that helped him to three 17-plus fantasy point showings in four full games back in 2023. The 36-year-old is not worth your attention on draft day and, if called on to start, will be no more than a back-end QB2."

He threw as many TDs (nine) as he did INTs (nine) and has still yet to clear 20.0 fantasy points in a single game in his pro career. Rudolph was not particularly effective and his 6.7 YPA and 64% completion percentage on 228 attempts last season exactly mirror his career rates. The 30-year-old will back up Aaron Rodgers this season and, even with DK Metcalf, Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth at his disposal, won't be a fantasy option even if asked to make a few starts."

This will be the journeyman's fifth team in seven seasons and he made multiple starts at each of his prior homes (Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Las Vegas). Minshew has yet to play a full regular season and his best fantasy campaign was a 19th-place finish in 2019 (he was 13th on a per-game basis in 2020, but only appeared in nine games). Minshew played in 10 games with the Raiders last season, but threw more INTs (10) than touchdowns (nine) and eventually lost his starting job to Aidan O'Connell. Minshew is well off the fantasy radar and would only join the QB2 conversation if Mahomes were to miss time."

He's primarily been a backup and spot-starter over the past five seasons, but he made seven straight starts in relief of injured Deshaun Watson last season. The result was what you expect from Winston, as he had his share of big plays (both good and bad) and ended up with 12 pass TDs and 12 INTs. Winston is likely to back up Russell Wilson and perhaps rookie Jaxson Dart this season. If called upon to start, he may add some big-play opportunities for the team's pass catchers, but will be no more than a desperation streaming option in deep leagues."
