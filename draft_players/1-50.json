His career year included nine top-10 fantasy weeks (three more than any other receiver), as well as the most routes, targets, receptions, yards, touchdowns and end zone targets (17) in the league. He has finished in the top 12 in fantasy PPG in all four of his NFL seasons, including top 5 in three of them. Chase became the league's highest-paid non-quarterback during the offseason and is a heavily targeted 25-year-old superstar on the league's pass-heaviest offense with an elite QB in Joe Burrow. He should be the first WR off the board and is a strong option with the No. 1 overall pick."

He scored 14 TDs and had at least 18 touches in all but one game (a blowout) during the span. Robinson finished top 5 among RBs in snaps, carries, routes, targets, touches, yards and fantasy points. Entering his age-23 campaign and working in an Atlanta offense that was the third-run-heaviest in the league last season, Robinson is primed for another elite season and should be under consideration with the first overall pick of your draft."

Despite resting at times (including all of Week 18), Barkley led the NFL in carries, touches and scrimmage yards, which led to a position-best 22.2 fantasy PPG. Barkley, who averaged a career-best 5.8 YPC, does carry some risk, though, as he enters his age-28 campaign off a season with an absurd 482 touches (including the playoffs). He'll need to sustain his elite rushing output, as he isn't a big factor in the passing game (outside the top 25 in targets, catches and yards). He nonetheless remains in a great spot behind the Eagles' terrific offensive line and should be off the board in the first round of fantasy drafts."

Despite Dak Prescott missing more than half the season, Lamb managed his third straight top-8 fantasy campaign and only two receivers accrued more touches. In his prime at age 26, Lamb remains one of the league's best receivers and he will get Prescott back this season. He's a solid WR1 option with elite upside who may come at a slight discount on draft day."

He led all receivers in yards per route run (3.7). The one concern with Nacua is touchdowns, as he has only 10 in 28 career games, and he was limited to six end zone targets (53rd at WR) in 2024. That said, with Cooper Kupp out and Davante Adams in, Nacua remains well positioned for a massive target share in a good Rams offense that has led the NFL in WR targets each of the last two seasons. After finishing sixth in fantasy PPG as a rookie and third in 2024, Nacua should be off the board in the first round."

Thomas' volume will need to increase in Year 2 in order to sustain WR1 fantasy production and, while it's reasonable to expect that boost, it's worth noting he had six 10-plus target games with backup Mac Jones (22.9 fantasy PPG those six weeks) but zero with starter Trevor Lawrence (14.4). The bottom line is Thomas appears to be the real deal and, even with Travis Hunter added to the mix, he has a path to a massive target share in a Liam Coen scheme that was extremely generous to Tampa Bay's wide receivers.

Last season, Brown missed four games and saw a dip in targets (from 9.8 in 2023 to 7.5 in 2024), with the latter a product of the Eagles leading so often. Brown actually posted a career-high 34.6% target share and averaged 3.3 yards per route run (both were second highest among WRs, and he's finished five straight seasons in the top 8 in both categories). Brown was extremely boom/bust, as he posted six top-10 fantasy outings (second most) but was held below 13.5 points in six of his other seven games. The 28-year-old is once again positioned as Jalen Hurts' top target and can be viewed as a fringe WR1."

London ranked eighth or better among receivers in targets, receptions, yards, TDs, end zone targets and fantasy points last season, but his production was very boom/bust. The only two games in which he reached 20 fantasy points were 33-plus-point efforts (and one was in Week 18). London's ceiling and consistency are impacted by Atlanta's run-heavy scheme, but his hefty share of the targets should be enough to allow borderline-WR1 numbers, especially if Michael Penix Jr. makes a Year 2 leap."

The five-year vet finished last season top 5 among RBs in carries and rushing yards, averaging a healthy 4.72 YPC along the way. Taylor did miss three games due to injury and has now managed just one full season in his career (2021). He's also struggled to make much of an impact as a pass catcher, having never finished a season top 20 in targets. Taylor's heavy rushing workload allowed him to produce good fantasy numbers regardless of who was under center last season and, while the lack of receiving will limit his ceiling, we should expect the same in 2025. Taylor is best valued as a midrange RB1."

Bowers' season could've been even better had he seen more goal-line work (he was limited to five TDs and six end zone targets).

Hill finished 31st among WRs in fantasy PPG after ranking no lower than 11th the prior seven seasons.

He remained his usual elite self as a rusher (he's finished first or second among QBs in rushing yards all seven seasons), but also made a huge leap as a passer (career highs in pass attempts, completions, yards and TDs, as well as a career-low four INTs and a league-high 8.8 YPA). The only 'knock' on Jackson that is relative to other top fantasy QBs is rushing TDs (he has 14 total over the last four seasons and had zero carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line last season), but he does more than enough otherwise to provide elite fantasy output. With an almost-identical supporting cast to 2024, we should expect more of the same from the 28-year-old this season."

The dual-threat playmaker was productive as a passer and even better as a rusher, ranking no lower than third among QBs in carries, rushing yards, rush TDs, carries inside the 5 and scrambles. Daniels produced 355.8 fantasy points, which trails only Cam Newton (370.3) for most by a rookie. He showed a high ceiling, having delivered 24-plus points in eight games, including his final five full regular-season outings). Entering Year 2 with an even better supporting cast that now includes Deebo Samuel Sr. and Laremy Tunsil, Daniels has a strong case to be the first QB off the board in fantasy drafts."

On the other, he's an explosive playmaker (4.87 YPC) in an elite offense who tied for the NFL lead 16 rushing touchdowns in 16 regular season games last season. Cook is obviously a strong bet for touchdown regression to the mean (especially considering he had nine TDs during his first two seasons), but the 25-year-old gets enough run in a great offense to produce starting-caliber fantasy numbers.

The 2023 first-round pick got more downfield opportunities in 2024 than he did as a rookie and perhaps will get even more in 2025 with DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett out and Cooper Kupp in as his wide receiver running mate. Smith-Njigba will also have a new playcaller (Klint Kubiak) and quarterback (Sam Darnold), which adds some uncertainty, but the bottom line is he's an emerging star and, at 23 years old, younger than some incoming rookies.

Despite the success, there is some 'sustainability' concern here, as McLaurin's volume didn't change much from years past and he finished outside the top 30 in routes and target share. He's finished exactly 19th among WRs in targets three seasons in a row and has never finished higher than 15th in catches or ninth in yards.

He finished sixth or better among WRs in targets all three seasons, but has yet to finish a season better than 20th in fantasy PPG due to underwhelming TD totals (14 in 51 games). Wilson's assured of a hefty target share, which will keep him fantasy-relevant, but his overall volume may suffer with dual-threat Justin Fields now under center.

On the concerning side is durability, as Kamara hasn't played a full regular season since his rookie year (2017) and is now 30 years old.

    "outlook_2025": "The 2024 season was a major disappointment for the Jets and that also applies to Hall's fantasy output. The 2022 second-round pick was a clear-cut fantasy RB1 during his first two seasons (eighth in PPG in 2022, sixth in 2023) prior to falling to 17th in 2024. Hall remained a clear lead back (only four RBs played more snaps) and was a force as a receiver (top 5 in routes, targets, catches and yards for the second season in a row), but pedestrian efficiency and rushing volume kept him outside the top 12 RBs in touches, yards and TDs. Hall is a good back and in his prime at age 24, so there's certainly so post-hype appeal in a new scheme with Justin Fields in at quarterback, but it's also likely that he'll share more work with Braelon Allen. Hall is best as a mid-range RB2."

    "outlook_2025": "Evans is back for his age-32 campaign having now put up 1,000-plus receiving yards in 11 straight seasons to begin his career. The future Hall of Famer missed three games in 2024, but still scored double-digit touchdowns for the fourth time in five seasons. Incredibly, Evans has never finished a season worse than 23rd in fantasy points (26th in PPG). Age aside, there are some concerns here, as Evans was very boom/bust in 2024, having posted six top-10 fantasy outings (second most), while also falling short of 12 points in seven of his other eight games. He also benefited massively from Chris Godwin's season-ending injury, averaging 6.3 targets and 13.6 fantasy PPG with him, but 9.1 targets and 20.7 PPG without. Despite the concerns, Evans hasn't shown signs of slowing down and has a good QB in Baker Mayfield. He's a fringe fantasy WR2."

    "outlook_2025": "Harrison is a candidate for a Year 2 leap after he didn't quite live up to the 'fourth overall pick' hype as a rookie. In some ways, Harrison was afforded plenty of opportunity -- he ranked third in the league in end zone targets (17) and ninth in air yards (1,518) -- but he was limited in other ways (zero designed screens and a deep-threat role that led to an ugly 54% catch rate and 22% off-target rate). Harrison scored eight TDs, but finished 37th in catches and 30th in both yards and fantasy points (41st in PPG). There's some obvious risk here, but Harrison was drafted with the expectation he'd be an elite player and it's only logical that he'll be treated that way in terms of usage in his second season. If that happens, the sky is the limit in terms of fantasy production. There's some projection here, but Harrison should be valued as a fringe WR2."

    "outlook_2025": "Metcalf was traded to Pittsburgh after spending his first six NFL seasons in Seattle. Metcalf has proven durable (he's missed three games in his career), but he hasn't quite lived up to lofty expectations. Despite leading the NFL (by 10) with 96 end zone targets since entering the league, Metcalf has finished one season in the top 20 among WRs in fantasy PPG (10th in 2020), though he has finished top 25 in four of his past five seasons. His vertical role has limited his catch total and his scoring has underwhelmed lately, as well (6.3 TDs per season since 2022). With minimal mouths to feed in Pittsburgh, Metcalf is assured of a big target share courtesy of Aaron Rodgers and has the look of a fringe WR2."

    "outlook_2025": "Moore has emerged as one of the league's most reliable and consistent players, having missed only two games in his seven-year career while finishing each of the past six seasons as a top-25 fantasy receiver. Working in a crowded Chicago WR room with a rookie QB last season, Moore did see a dip in fantasy output (from ninth in PPG in 2023 to 28th in 2024), but he was still very productive, finishing ninth among WRs in targets and receptions. Moore did improve dramatically in the second half of the season (11.1 fantasy PPG during Weeks 1-10, but 17.3 in eight games once OC Shane Waldron was fired), which is notable as Ben Johnson takes over the offense. Entering his age-28 season, Moore is a fine WR2 target and a career year is very possible if Caleb Williams makes a Year 2 leap."

    "outlook_2025": "Rice is undoubtedly one of the biggest wild cards in fantasy football this season. On one hand, he has been an absolute fantasy superstar since taking on a substantial role midway through his rookie season in 2023. During that span (nine regular-season games), Rice is averaging 19.5 fantasy PPG. In three full games last season, he handled a massive 36% target share (10.7 per game) and averaged 21.6 PPG (17-plus in all three). On the other hand, Rice tore his LCL in Week 3, is facing a potential suspension and, even when active, he now has legitimate target competition via Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown and Travis Kelce. The good news is that 25-year-old Rice is expected to be fully healthy prior to Week 1 and will be a featured target when on the field. He has WR1 upside, but won't cost quite that much on draft day."

    "outlook_2025": "The Chiefs selected Worthy in the first round last year and the speedster was a major difference-maker right out of the gate. He was involved as both a rusher and receiver, dominating with the ball in his hands (his 7.0 RAC was ninth best among WRs). Perhaps the most notable nugget pertaining to Worthy is his late-season emergence. He handled a hefty 26% target share (8.7 per game) in his final six games (including the playoffs) and scored at least 19 fantasy points in five of those games. Working with a QB (Patrick Mahomes) who has finished top 10 in passing yards and TDs seven straight years, as well as with Travis Kelce aging and Rashee Rice facing a possible suspension after missing most of 2024, the 22-year-old Worthy is well positioned for a big breakout. He's an intriguing WR2 target."
