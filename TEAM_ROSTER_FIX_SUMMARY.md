# Team Roster Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The Current Team Roster card on the draft page was not updating the team's roster as the draft progressed. The roster remained empty even after picks were made.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `Sidebar.jsx` component's `getCurrentRoster()` function. The function was trying to filter picks by `pick.teamId`, but the server stores the team information as `pick.team` (the full team object), not `pick.teamId`.

### Server Structure (Correct)
```javascript
const pick = {
  pickNumber: draftState.pickHistory.length + 1,
  pickIndex: draftState.currentPick,
  round: Math.floor(draftState.currentPick / draftState.leagueSize) + 1,
  pickInRound: (draftState.currentPick % draftState.leagueSize) + 1,
  team: { ...currentTeam },  // Full team object
  player: player,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  isAutoPick
};
```

### Client Code (Before Fix - Incorrect)
```javascript
const getCurrentRoster = () => {
  if (!draftState?.pickHistory) return [];
  
  const currentTeam = getCurrentTeam();
  if (!currentTeam) return [];
  
  // ❌ WRONG: pick.teamId doesn't exist
  return draftState.pickHistory
    .filter(pick => pick.teamId === currentTeam.id)
    .map(pick => ({
      player: pick.player,
      pickIndex: pick.pickIndex
    }));
};
```

### Client Code (After Fix - Correct)
```javascript
const getCurrentRoster = () => {
  if (!draftState?.pickHistory) return [];
  
  const currentTeam = getCurrentTeam();
  if (!currentTeam) return [];
  
  // ✅ CORRECT: pick.team.id exists
  return draftState.pickHistory
    .filter(pick => pick.team && pick.team.id === currentTeam.id)
    .map(pick => ({
      player: pick.player,
      pickIndex: pick.pickIndex
    }));
};
```

## Fix Applied
**File**: `client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx`
**Line**: 28
**Change**: Updated the filter condition from `pick.teamId === currentTeam.id` to `pick.team && pick.team.id === currentTeam.id`

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing
1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Start server
   cd server && npm start
   
   # Terminal 2 - Start client
   cd client && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   - Open browser to: http://localhost:5173
   - Login as admin or create a new account

3. **Create and start a draft**:
   - Create a new draft with 12 teams
   - Start the draft
   - Make some picks

4. **Verify the fix**:
   - Look at the "Current Team Roster" card in the sidebar
   - As picks are made, the roster should update to show only the current team's drafted players
   - The roster should change when the current team changes
   - Each position should show the correct count (e.g., "QB: 1/4")

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ **Before picks**: Roster shows empty with "No QB players drafted yet", etc.
- ✅ **After first pick**: Roster shows the drafted player in the correct position
- ✅ **Team changes**: Roster updates to show the new current team's players
- ✅ **Position counts**: Shows correct counts like "QB: 1/4", "RB: 2/8", etc.
- ✅ **Pick information**: Shows pick details like "Pick 1.1", "Pick 2.12", etc.

### Verification Points
1. **Team switching**: When the draft moves to a different team, the roster should update
2. **Position filtering**: Only show positions that have drafted players
3. **Pick history**: Each player should show which pick they were selected with
4. **Real-time updates**: Roster should update immediately when picks are made

## Files Modified
- `client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` - Fixed the team roster filtering logic

## Related Components
The fix only affects the Sidebar component. Other components like `DraftBoard.jsx` and `DisplayPage.jsx` were already using the correct structure (`pick.team.name` instead of `pick.teamId`).

## Impact
This fix resolves the issue where the Current Team Roster card was not displaying any players, making it now properly show the current team's drafted players and update in real-time as the draft progresses.
