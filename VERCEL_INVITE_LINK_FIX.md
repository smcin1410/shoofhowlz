# Vercel Invite Link Fix

## Problem
The draft invite links are not working on Vercel deployment, even though they work locally.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Vercel Route Configuration Issue**
The original `vercel.json` only had a catch-all route that didn't properly handle the specific invite link routes:
- `/join/:draftId/team/:teamId`
- `/drafts/:draftId`

### 2. **Base URL Detection**
The `window.location.origin` might not work correctly in all Vercel environments.

### 3. **Client-Side Routing**
React Router needs proper configuration to handle deep links on Vercel.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated Vercel Configuration** (`client/vercel.json`)
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "handle": "filesystem"
    },
    {
      "src": "/join/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/drafts/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/display",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/results",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Base URL Detection** (`DraftInviteModal.jsx`)
```javascript
const getBaseUrl = () => {
  // Check if we're in production (Vercel)
  if (window.location.hostname.includes('vercel.app')) {
    return `https://${window.location.hostname}`;
  }
  // Check if we're in development
  if (window.location.hostname === 'localhost') {
    return window.location.origin;
  }
  // Fallback to origin
  return window.location.origin;
};
```

## Files Modified

### `client/vercel.json`
- ✅ Added specific route handlers for invite links
- ✅ Added route handlers for all app routes
- ✅ Maintained filesystem handling for static assets

### `client/src/components/DraftInviteModal.jsx`
- ✅ Enhanced base URL detection for Vercel
- ✅ Added fallback logic for different environments
- ✅ Improved production URL generation

## Testing Steps

### 1. **Deploy the Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel invite links - update routing and base URL detection"
git push
```

### 2. **Verify Vercel Deployment**
- Check that the new `vercel.json` is deployed
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Test the main app loads properly

### 3. **Test Invite Links**
Generate test links and verify they work:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/join/test-draft-123/team/1
https://your-app.vercel.app/drafts/test-draft-123
```

### 4. **Check Browser Console**
Look for any JavaScript errors or routing issues.

## Troubleshooting

### If Links Still Don't Work:

#### 1. **Check Vercel Deployment**
- Go to Vercel dashboard
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Verify `vercel.json` is being used

#### 2. **Verify Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in Vercel:
```
VITE_SERVER_URL=https://shoof-howlz-backend.onrender.com
```

#### 3. **Test Route Handling**
Try accessing these URLs directly:
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/join/test/team/1`
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/drafts/test`

#### 4. **Check Network Tab**
- Open browser dev tools
- Go to Network tab
- Click an invite link
- Check if the request is handled correctly

#### 5. **Verify Server Connection**
- Check if the backend server is accessible
- Verify CORS settings allow Vercel domain
- Test Socket.IO connection

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: 404 Errors on Invite Links
**Solution**: Ensure `vercel.json` routes are properly configured and deployed.

#### Issue: Links Redirect to Home Page
**Solution**: Check that React Router is properly handling the routes.

#### Issue: Server Connection Fails
**Solution**: Verify `VITE_SERVER_URL` is set correctly in Vercel environment variables.

#### Issue: Base URL Detection Fails
**Solution**: The enhanced base URL detection should handle this automatically.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ **Working Invite Links**
- Team-specific links: `/join/:draftId/team/:teamId`
- General draft links: `/drafts/:draftId`
- All links should load the correct components

### ✅ **Proper URL Generation**
- Production URLs use `https://` protocol
- Vercel domains are handled correctly
- Fallback to `window.location.origin` for other domains

### ✅ **Seamless User Experience**
- Users can click invite links and join drafts directly
- No 404 errors or routing issues
- Proper team assignment based on invite link

## Monitoring

### After Deployment:
1. **Test all invite link types**
2. **Monitor for 404 errors**
3. **Check user feedback**
4. **Verify team assignment works**

### Long-term:
1. **Track invite link usage**
2. **Monitor conversion rates**
3. **Check for any recurring issues**

## Future Improvements

1. **Analytics**: Track invite link clicks and success rates
2. **Error Handling**: Better error messages for failed joins
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure links work well on mobile devices
4. **QR Codes**: Generate QR codes for easy mobile sharing
