# Draft Invite Link Fix

## Problem
The draft invite links were not working because there was a mismatch between:
- **Generated links**: `/drafts/${draft.id}` 
- **Actual routes**: `/join/:draftId/team/:teamId`

## Root Cause
1. **Route Mismatch**: The invite links were generating `/drafts/${draft.id}` but the application only had a route for `/join/:draftId/team/:teamId`
2. **Missing Team ID**: The generated links didn't include the team ID parameter required for direct team joining
3. **No Fallback Route**: There was no route to handle the general `/drafts/:draftId` format

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Invite Link Generation (`DraftInviteModal.jsx`)
- **Team-Specific Links**: Now generates individual invite links for each team with an email
- **Correct URL Format**: Uses `/join/:draftId/team/:teamId` format
- **Fallback Support**: Provides fallback link if no team emails are configured

```javascript
// Before
const draftLink = `${baseUrl}/drafts/${draft.id}`;

// After
const generateTeamInviteLinks = () => {
  return draft.teams
    .filter(team => team.email && team.email.trim() !== '')
    .map(team => ({
      teamId: team.id,
      teamName: team.name,
      email: team.email,
      inviteLink: `${baseUrl}/join/${draft.id}/team/${team.id}`
    }));
};
```

### 2. Enhanced UI Display
- **Multiple Team Links**: Shows individual invite links for each team
- **Team Information**: Displays team name and email for each link
- **Copy Functionality**: Copies all team links when using "Copy Link" option

### 3. Added General Draft Route
- **New Route**: `/drafts/:draftId` → `DraftRedirect` component
- **Redirect Logic**: Stores draft ID in localStorage and redirects to main app
- **Main App Integration**: Main app checks for redirect draft ID on load

### 4. Updated Email Invitations
- **Team-Specific Content**: Email includes individual links for each team
- **Better Messaging**: Updated invitation text to reflect direct team assignment

## Files Modified

### `client/src/components/DraftInviteModal.jsx`
- ✅ Fixed invite link generation
- ✅ Added team-specific link display
- ✅ Enhanced copy/share functionality
- ✅ Updated email invitation content

### `client/src/App.jsx`
- ✅ Added `/drafts/:draftId` route
- ✅ Added redirect draft ID handling
- ✅ Imported `DraftRedirect` component

### `client/src/components/DraftRedirect.jsx` (New)
- ✅ Created redirect component for general draft links
- ✅ Handles localStorage communication with main app

## Testing

### Test Results
```
✅ Team-specific links generated: 4
✅ Fallback link: http://localhost:3000/join/test-draft-123/team/1
✅ General link: http://localhost:3000/drafts/test-draft-123
```

### Generated Links Example
```
Team Alpha (alpha@test.com): http://localhost:3000/join/test-draft-123/team/1
Team Beta (beta@test.com): http://localhost:3000/join/test-draft-123/team/2
Team Gamma (gamma@test.com): http://localhost:3000/join/test-draft-123/team/3
Team Echo (echo@test.com): http://localhost:3000/join/test-draft-123/team/5
```

## Benefits

1. **Working Invite Links**: Users can now successfully join drafts via invite links
2. **Team-Specific Joining**: Each team gets their own direct join link
3. **Backward Compatibility**: General draft links still work via redirect
4. **Better UX**: Clear team assignment and streamlined joining process
5. **Email Integration**: Proper email invitations with team-specific links

## Usage

### For Commissioners

## Future Enhancements

1. **QR Code Generation**: Add QR codes for mobile sharing
