After a slow start, the 2023 first-round pick averaged 23.3 touches, 120.9 yards and 22.8 fantasy points (first at RB) from Week 6 on. He scored 14 TDs and had at least 18 touches in all but one game (a blowout) during the span. Robinson finished top 5 among RBs in snaps, carries, routes, targets, touches, yards and fantasy points. Entering his age-23 campaign and working in an Atlanta offense that was the third-run-heaviest in the league last season, Robinson is primed for another elite season and should be under consideration with the first overall pick of your draft."

Darnold is gone, but 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy could conceivably be an upgrade in Kevin O'Connell's pass-first scheme.

Despite resting at times (including all of Week 18), Barkley led the NFL in carries, touches and scrimmage yards, which led to a position-best 22.2 fantasy PPG. Barkley, who averaged a career-best 5.8 YPC, does carry some risk, though, as he enters his age-28 campaign off a season with an absurd 482 touches (including the playoffs). He'll need to sustain his elite rushing output, as he isn't a big factor in the passing game (outside the top 25 in targets, catches and yards). He nonetheless remains in a great spot behind the Eagles' terrific offensive line and should be off the board in the first round of fantasy drafts."

Montgomery is back, so Gibbs' touch ceiling may be slightly lower than a few other top backs, but with his skill set and Detroit's high-powered offense, he's undoubtedly a strong fantasy RB1.

Despite Dak Prescott missing more than half the season, Lamb managed his third straight top-8 fantasy campaign and only two receivers accrued more touches. In his prime at age 26, Lamb remains one of the league's best receivers and he will get Prescott back this season. He's a solid WR1 option with elite upside who may come at a slight discount on draft day."

Once he was full-go in Week 10, Nacua went on to handle a massive 37% target share (11.3 per game) and his average of 22.3 fantasy points during the span would have ranked second over the full season. He led all receivers in yards per route run (3.7). The one concern with Nacua is touchdowns, as he has only 10 in 28 career games, and he was limited to six end zone targets (53rd at WR) in 2024. That said, with Cooper Kupp out and Davante Adams in, Nacua remains well positioned for a massive target share in a good Rams offense that has led the NFL in WR targets each of the last two seasons. After finishing sixth in fantasy PPG as a rookie and third in 2024, Nacua should be off the board in the first round."

He appears to be the real deal and his outlook is even better in 2025 with Russell Wilson (and perhaps Jaxson Dart and/or Jameis Winston) under center.

With Stefon Diggs gone and Tank Dell uncertain to play in 2025, Collins is ticketed for massive usage as C.J. Stroud's clear No. 1 target. He's a solid WR1 option in fantasy."

That's the number of wide receivers selected before Thomas in the 2024 draft and it's also the number of wide receivers who outscored him in fantasy during his rookie season. The LSU product finished in the top 5 among receivers in both yards and TDs despite ranking 29th in routes and 19th in targets. Thomas' volume will need to increase in Year 2 in order to sustain WR1 fantasy production and, while it's reasonable to expect that boost, it's worth noting he had six 10-plus target games with backup Mac Jones (22.9 fantasy PPG those six weeks) but zero with starter Trevor Lawrence (14.4). The bottom line is Thomas appears to be the real deal and, even with Travis Hunter added to the mix, he has a path to a massive target share in a Liam Coen scheme that was extremely generous to Tampa Bay's wide receivers. Thomas is a good back-end WR1 target."

He's also struggled to make much of an impact as a pass catcher, having never finished a season top 20 in targets. Taylor's heavy rushing workload allowed him to produce good fantasy numbers regardless of who was under center last season and, while the lack of receiving will limit his ceiling, we should expect the same in 2025.

Bowers' season could've been even better had he seen more goal-line work (he was limited to five TDs and six end zone targets).

Granted, he wasn't fully healthy, but Hill appeared in all 17 games and still managed to see a massive dip in targets, catches, yardage, TDs and fantasy points, compared to his first two seasons in Miami. Hill finished 31st among WRs in fantasy PPG after ranking no lower than 11th the prior seven seasons. It didn't help that Tua Tagovailoa missed six games (Hill averaged 9.0 PPG in those weeks), but he wasn't his usual, elite self even with Tagovailoa (14.9 PPG). Hill was the No. 2 fantasy WR three of four seasons before the 2024 dud, so a potential rebound season is worth factoring in, but it's not a lock as he enters his age-31 campaign. He's safest as a WR2 with upside."

Following a bit of an inconsistent start, McConkey heated up down the stretch and ended up 12th in fantasy points (18th in PPG). Including the playoffs, the 2024 second-round pick caught five or more passes in eight straight games to end the season. The 23-year-old has already emerged as Justin Herbert's top target and his short-to-intermediate role puts a 100-plus catch season in play in 2025.

Despite missing three games and being traded, Adams delivered five top-10 fantasy weeks, which tied for fourth among WRs. Adams has now finished top 15 in fantasy PPG each of the past 10 seasons and, while he won't be the No. 1 target in Los Angeles, there are more than enough targets to go around in Sean McVay's scheme with Matthew Stafford under center (the Rams have led the NFL in WR targets each of the last two seasons).

The only 'knock' on Jackson that is relative to other top fantasy QBs is rushing TDs (he has 14 total over the last four seasons and had zero carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line last season), but he does more than enough otherwise to provide elite fantasy output.

He's finished exactly 19th among WRs in targets three seasons in a row and has never finished higher than 15th in catches or ninth in yards.

        "outlook_2025": "Walker is entering his fourth NFL season eyeing a bounce-back after injuries limited him to career-low marks in touches, yardage and touchdowns in 2024. The good news is that the 2022 second-round pick remained Seattle's clear feature back and was productive when active. In those 11 games, he averaged 18.1 touches, 79.3 yards and a career-high 16.5 fantasy points per game. Despite the missed action, Walker hit career-best marks in targets, catches and receiving yards thanks to a hefty 14% target share (fifth highest among RBs). Still only 24 years old, Walker is a prime rebound candidate and the boost in receiving work (assuming that sticks under new OC Klint Kubiak) adds to his ceiling. Walker is a solid RB2 target."

Burrow, who was off target on a league-low 11% of his attempts, has now finished eighth or better in fantasy points each season he's appeared in more than 10 games (fourth or better in the last two). He'll continue to benefit from the league's pass-heaviest offense, as well as the terrific Ja'Marr Chase/Tee Higgins duo.

On the concerning side is durability, as Kamara hasn't played a full regular season since his rookie year (2017) and is now 30 years old. Additionally, the Saints' offense figures to struggle following Derek Carr's retirement.

Hall remained a clear lead back (only four RBs played more snaps) and was a force as a receiver (top 5 in routes, targets, catches and yards for the second season in a row), but pedestrian efficiency and rushing volume kept him outside the top 12 RBs in touches, yards and TDs. Hall is a good back and in his prime at age 24, so there's certainly so post-hype appeal in a new scheme with Justin Fields in at quarterback, but it's also likely that he'll share more work with Braelon Allen. Hall is best as a mid-range RB2."

There's some obvious risk here, but Harrison was drafted with the expectation he'd be an elite player and it's only logical that he'll be treated that way in terms of usage in his second season.

        "outlook_2025": "Rice is undoubtedly one of the biggest wild cards in fantasy football this season. On one hand, he has been an absolute fantasy superstar since taking on a substantial role midway through his rookie season in 2023. During that span (nine regular-season games), Rice is averaging 19.5 fantasy PPG. In three full games last season, he handled a massive 36% target share (10.7 per game) and averaged 21.6 PPG (17-plus in all three). On the other hand, Rice tore his LCL in Week 3, is facing a potential suspension and, even when active, he now has legitimate target competition via Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown and Travis Kelce. The good news is that 25-year-old Rice is expected to be fully healthy prior to Week 1 and will be a featured target when on the field. He has WR1 upside, but won't cost quite that much on draft day."

He was involved as both a rusher and receiver, dominating with the ball in his hands (his 7.0 RAC was ninth best among WRs). Perhaps the most notable nugget pertaining to Worthy is his late-season emergence. He handled a hefty 26% target share (8.7 per game) in his final six games (including the playoffs) and scored at least 19 fantasy points in five of those games. Working with a QB (Patrick Mahomes) who has finished top 10 in passing yards and TDs seven straight years, as well as with Travis Kelce aging and Rashee Rice facing a possible suspension after missing most of 2024, the 22-year-old Worthy is well positioned for a big breakout.

We likely haven't seen Pickens' best work, but there's enough uncertainty here that the 24-year-old should be valued as a midrange WR3."

His receiving line dipped across the board (from 86-889-10 on 121 targets to 60-726-7 on 84 targets), though it's notable he got back on track to some extent after a slow start. After averaging 2.8 targets (11% team share) and 7.1 fantasy points during his first six games, LaPorta leapt to 6.7 targets (21% share) and 13.6 fantasy points in his final 11 (including the playoffs). Those numbers are nearly identical to his rookie season and closer to what we should expect moving forward. Working in Detroit's elite offense, LaPorta is a solid TE1."

Mahomes has evolved into a quarterback who still attempts a ton of passes (exactly third in pass attempts four years in a row), but is more conservative (career-low 6.4 aDOT and 6.8 YPA in 2024) and doesn't throw as many TDs as in years past (26 last season was his fewest since 2019). Perhaps he'll rebound a bit in that area with the Xavier Worthy/Rashee Rice/Hollywood Brown trio together, but in the meantime Mahomes adds just enough with his legs (between 300 and 400 yards five seasons in a row) to keep him in the fantasy starter conversation."

He finished no lower than fifth in pass attempts, completions, yards and TDs, while also easily posting a career high in rush yards. Mayfield completed 71% of his passes (third best) despite missing Chris Godwin and Mike Evans for chunks of the season, and he may be in even better shape in 2025 with Evans back, Godwin hopefully healthy and youngsters Emeka Egbuka and Jalen McMillan also in the mix. Mayfield benefits from a Bucs offense that has scored a league-high 76.6% of its TDs through the air since Todd Bowles became head coach in 2022.

Odunze had some poor scoring luck (three TDs, 6.7 expected), which was partially to blame for him scoring single-digit fantasy points in 13 of 17 games. There are a lot of mouths to feed in Chicago, but with Caleb Williams entering Year 2 and Ben Johnson now running the offense, Odunze is an extremely logical breakout candidate.

Dobbins is his primary competition for work. The duo may split carries, but Harvey is a good bet to emerge as the primary receiving back, which is notable in a Sean Payton offense that often leans heavily on RBs in the passing game. Harvey is a fringe RB2 target, but there's upside for even more."

In his seven games, the veteran receiver averaged 19.7 fantasy PPG and caught 79% of his passes, both of which ranked second at the position. Perhaps most notably, Godwin scored five TDs in seven games, which was somewhat unsustainable (2.1 xTD) but nonetheless a step forward after he totaled 10 TDs the prior three seasons (46 games). Godwin is still in his prime at age 29 and now seemingly Baker Mayfield's top target, but it's unclear if he'll be healthy to begin the 2025 season. If he is, he's well positioned for a big comeback season and on the WR1 radar. If not, he'll make for more of a midround lottery ticket."

The veteran is one of 10 receivers with 67-plus receptions and 800-plus receiving yards in each of the past four seasons and he peaked with career highs in targets, catches, yards and end zone targets (11) in 2024.

He handled a 24% target share, which wasn't far off his 27% and 25% rates during his first two seasons. The 2022 first-round pick has yet to reach his ceiling (he's yet to clear five TDs in a season), but he produced top-25 fantasy campaigns in his first two seasons and is set up well to pace New Orleans in targets in 2025. Of course, there's added risk here as the Saints turn to rookie QB Tyler Shough following Derek Carr's retirement. Olave is safest as a WR3/flex, with a hint of post-hype sleeper appeal."

That led to boom/bust production last season, as he scored 43% of his fantasy points in three games and was held to single digits in seven of 15 outings. Addison is suspended three games to begin the 2025 season, but once he's on the field, he will continue battling for looks with Justin Jefferson and T.J. Hockenson.

He was a top-10 scorer in seven of 11 games and finished top 5 at the position in targets for the second season in a row. Njoku has rarely been very productive in the scoring department (his career high is six touchdowns), but he found the end zone five times last season and has now led the position in end zone targets two years in a row. Despite Cleveland's never-ending QB issues, Njoku has finished 11th or better in three consecutive fantasy campaigns (top 8 in PPG) and the 29-year-old remains a midrange TE1."

After handling a target share in the 22-to-28% range during 2019-23 (all were top 4 at the position), Andrews dipped to 15% in 2024 (20th) and finished 20th in targets, 14th in catches, ninth in yards and first in TDs among tight ends. Andrews has always been extremely efficient when targeted (he's never finished lower than fifth in YPRR), but he's also never been quite as TD dependent (11 TDs in 2024 were a career high and his 16.2% TD rate was way above his prior career rate of 7.1%). Andrews was bailed out by the TD outlier and will need to bounce back in the target area in order to return to elite TE1 production."

Purdy missed two games and saw his passing TDs dip from 30 to 20, but he also took his rushing to a new level with career highs in carries, yards and TDs. By season's end, he was 10th among QBs in fantasy PPG, which was a slight dip from his eighth-place finish in 2023. Purdy has yet to finish a season better than 17th in pass attempts, but that could change in 2025 after several major defensive departures. With Kyle Shanahan calling the shots and a good supporting cast led by George Kittle, Christian McCaffrey and Trent Williams, Purdy is positioned well for another fringe-QB1 fantasy season."

The results were good in reality -- he caught 77% of his targets and was elite with the ball in his hands (7.9 RAC), both of which ranked fourth among WRs -- but not as much in fantasy. Shakir finished 35th in fantasy PPG and had little upside (his best weekly finish was 10th). He handled a 23% target share (an appealing number in a great offense), but most of it is in the short area (29% of his targets were screens) and he simply doesn't get much run near the goal line (seven career TDs and five career end zone targets). The 25-year-old's role drastically limits his ceiling and, especially with Keon Coleman and perhaps Dalton Kincaid ticketed for a leap forward, Shakir is best valued as a flex."

One of the league's most versatile offensive players, Samuel has 50-plus catches and 37-plus carries in each of the past four seasons. The fantasy output has been volatile, however, as he was a top-12 in PPG in 2021 and 2023, but outside the top 25 the other four seasons. Durability has been an issue, as he's yet to play a full regular season. With Terry McLaurin as his only notable target competition, Samuel has a path to similar usage to what he saw in San Francisco. That should allow starting-caliber fantasy production, but the high likelihood of missed action pushes him down to a midround draft-day target."

Coleman's role as a vertical target (his 15.0 aDOT ranked fifth) allowed him many big plays (his 19.2 YPR ranked third), but major volatility (51% catch rate). Coleman was a young rookie at age 21 and showed enough flashes to suggest a Year 2 breakout is possible, especially in a Josh Allen-led offense with Khalil Shakir and Joshua Palmer as his top competition.

He averaged 8.0 fantasy PPG, reaching double digits once (15.6 in Week 12). Pittman continues to struggle to find the end zone (his career high is six and he's had four or fewer three seasons in a row) and that may not change with Richardson under center (the Colts had eight pass TDs in his 10 games last season). As good a player as Pittman is, Richardson's presence will limit his fantasy output and life may not be much better if Daniel Jones is under center. Pittman is a flex option."

Allen is now 33-years-old (ancient for an NFL receiver) and hasn't played a full regular season since 2019. He's no longer a fantasy WR1 (he finished 34th in PPG last season), but he has a real shot to trail only Ladd McConkey in targets in a solid Los Angeles offense. Allen is a fine late-round flier for your bench and has WR3/flex upside."

Year 1 in Atlanta was a relative success despite Mooney playing behind Drake London in a run-heavy offense. The veteran receiver handled a 21% target share and had his best showings in targets, catches and yards since his breakout 2021 season. He also caught a career-high five touchdowns. Though Mooney played well, the production wasn't enough to allow his first top-30 fantasy campaign (PPG). Mooney remains locked into the No. 2 WR role in a Falcons' offense that very well could make a leap with Michael Penix Jr. entering his first season as the full-time starting quarterback. That's enough to put him on the flex radar, but his upside is limited."

The Colts' QB play has been an issue, as in seven full games with Anthony Richardson, Downs averaged 5.9 targets and 10.7 fantasy points per game, but in seven outings with Joe Flacco, he averaged 9.4 targets and 15.5 PPG. Downs, same as other Colts receivers, has struggled to produce with Richardson under center and it's no sure bet he'll be better if Daniel Jones wins the job. Downs is a good player, so he's worth late-round consideration, but the team's QB uncertainty will make him tough to plug into your lineup."

His 13.3 fantasy PPG ranked 34th among WRs and he hit the 15-point mark in four of his six games. One of the game's top deep threats and a contributor as a rusher and returner, Shaheed very well could find his way to weekly fantasy relevance in a similar way as Deebo Samuel Sr., albeit with more vertical work. Of course, he's yet to show that level of production over a full season and he'll need to fend off Chris Olave, Alvin Kamara and now Brandin Cooks for work in an offense that will have rookie QB Tyler Shough under center. Shaheed is a fine late-round lottery ticket."

Also a rushing and return threat, Egbuka will have a role right out of the gate, but just how sizable it is will depend on the health of Chris Godwin (ankle). And even if Godwin is sidelined, Mike Evans and second-year Jalen McMillan will be major offensive factors. Egbuka is a terrific dynasty hold, but he's only worth a late flier in 2025 leagues."

In those eight games, he wasn't much of a fantasy factor (10.0 PPG, clearing 12.8 once), which can somewhat be traced to a nonexistent role near the goal line (zero TDs or carries inside the 5). Ekeler was productive when Robinson was sidelined (3 TDs -- all from the 1-yard line -- and 15.4 PPG), so while he's now 30 years old and without standalone fantasy value, he has some insurance appeal."

This committee now includes rookie Bhayshul Tuten and is setting up to be a fantasy nightmare, though perhaps new coach Liam Coen can make some magic happen, as he did with Bucky Irving and Rachaad White in Tampa Bay last season.

One of only two backs with 50-plus receptions in each of the past three seasons (Alvin Kamara is the other), White figures to sustain a pass-catching role in a good offense, but Bucky Irving appears to be the new lead back in Tampa. White is a fine late-round insurance flier."

Though he wasn't a starting option in fantasy (his one top-10 outing came in Week 7), he played well (17th in QBR) and provided a respectable floor, averaging 16.4 fantasy PPG (that would've ranked 15th over the full season). New coach Mike Vrabel operated run-heavy offenses all six seasons in Tennessee, which may limit Maye's upside, but that could mostly be offset by Maye's rushing ability (he ranked ninth in yards, second in YPC and fifth in scrambles among QBs as a rookie). Especially if Stefon Diggs (ACL) will be ready to go in Week 1, Maye will make for an excellent late-round flier with upside."

He came out strong with a pair of top-3 fantasy outings in his first four games, but had no additional weekly finishes better than 10th for the season. Love was a nonfactor with his legs (83 rushing yards in 15 games) and, after totaling 15 pass TDs in his first five games, threw only 10 in his final 10 outings. Green Bay did score an unusually high percentage of its offensive TDs on the ground (46%, the second highest for a Matt LaFleur offense), but that may not change with Josh Jacobs back in 2025. Love ran more in 2023 and was a solid fantasy starter, so, especially with a better supporting cast led by first-round WR Matthew Golden, there's hope for a rebound, but it is safer to view him as a QB2."

With Ben Johnson leading the offense, Goff has finished sixth or better in passing yards and TDs each of the last three seasons, but he adds almost nothing with his legs (150 yards and two TDs total during the three seasons). Even during a productive 2024, Goff was inconsistent, as he posted eight top-10 fantasy weeks but was 17th or worse the other nine weeks. Especially with Johnson off to Chicago, Goff is likely to see some regression in key efficiency categories (his 72% completion rate and 8.6 YPA last season were way above his previous career highs) and, coupled with his lack of rushing, he has a very low fantasy ceiling. Goff will remain a productive passer, but he's no more than a QB2 with occasional streaming appeal."

Sampson's fantasy outlook is less than ideal, as second-round rookie Quinshon Judkins is the team's short- and long-term lead back, with Jerome Ford possibly a factor in 2025 as well. Sampson is barely worth late-round consideration, but is a fine dynasty hold."

Despite the success, Charbonnet was the clear No. 2 the 11 weeks Walker played, averaging 6.1 touches (10 max) and 6.5 fantasy points (12.1 max). Charbonnet is a young (24), high-pedigree (second-round) back who has played well, so perhaps new OC Klint Kubiak will give him more run. It is best to treat him as an elite insurance bench hold."

He's a bit on the small side (196 pounds) and has had fumble issues, but ran a strong 4.38 40 at the combine. Blue may open his career behind veterans Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders, but neither have played well in recent seasons so this depth chart is wide open.

His season ended the following week, but was enough to provide optimism about his future.

Brown has now missed game action in five of his six NFL seasons, including three or more games in three straight years. He has yet to produce a top-20 fantasy campaign in six tries and his lone top-35 finish came in 2021. Kansas City's wide receiver room is suddenly a bit crowded on paper and Brown may find his way to an every-down role only if Rashee Rice is suspended (which may not happen until 2026).

The 37-year-old continues to play good football (11th in QBR last season), but that hasn't translated to much fantasy success (27th in fantasy PPG last season and his last top-10 season was with Detroit in 2019). Stafford has finished each of the last two seasons just outside the top 10 in attempts, completions, pass yards and pass TDs, while also continuing to offer almost zero with his legs (39.5 rushing yards per season and one total rush TD since joining the Rams). A solid line and elite Puka Nacua/Davante Adams WR duo could help boost Stafford's passing numbers in 2025, but the lack of rushing will limit him to nothing more than a bye-week streamer."

He opened the season with two seventh-place fantasy weeks in his first four games, but proceeded to finish 14th or worse each of the 13 remaining weeks. He reached 20 fantasy points only once (Week 4). Still only 23, Stroud is still on the ascent, but he'll need to produce more through the air in order to offset mild-to-moderate rushing contributions.

Harris also figures to be very limited as a receiver, as Jim Harbaugh and Greg Roman have a long history of low RB usage in the pass game, in addition to the fact Harris has finished outside the top 20 RBs in targets each of the past two seasons. Harris has ranked in the 20-to-30 range in fantasy PPG each of the past three seasons, but even if he splits carries with Hampton, he'll be hard-pressed to produce consistent flex numbers."

He dominated the combine, posting RB-best marks in the 40 (4.32), speed score (118) and vertical (40.5). Tuten is fast, tough and has three-down ability, though his Year 1 opportunity is unclear with Travis Etienne Jr. and Tank Bigsby also on the depth chart. That could lead to a limited early-season role, but the uncertainty also allows him a chance to steal lead-back duties.

His efficiency wasn't overly impressive (3.6 YPC, 5.1 YPT) and he eventually deferred some work to 2024 fifth-rounder Isaiah Davis, but it's notable that he's still one of the league's youngest backs at 21-years-old. Despite speculation of a committee approach, Hall figures to remain the lead, or at least 1A' back this season, with Allen and Davis battling for the rest of the touches.

Bateman appeared in all 17 regular season games for the first time and, though his 15.4% target share was the second lowest of his career, he posted career-best marks in yardage, touchdowns and fantasy points. Targets remained inconsistent, however, and led to extremely boom/bust production (eight single-digit fantasy point games and a 47th-place finish in PPG, the latter of which is a career best). The 25-year-old is a capable situational deep threat (he's ranked top 12 in aDOT two years in a row), but he's a good bet for touchdown regression to the mean (4.6 expected TDs last season) and his usage is too volatile to allow weekly flex consideration."

Of course, Godwin was out during that stretch and, even if he misses some time in 2025, the team drafted Emeka Egbuka in the first round of April's draft. Consistent fantasy production will be hard for McMillan to find with Evans, Godwin and Egbuka in the mix, so he'll be only a deep-league flex option if Godwin is sidelined.

He cleared 12 touches only twice (Cook was out or limited for both) and was impressive (152 yards in Week 6, 65 yards and one TD in Week 18). The 25-year-old was effective as both a rusher and receiver and, as we saw in a small sample last season, he'd likely be Buffalo's lead back (with Johnson also plenty involved) in the event of a Cook injury.

Granted it was a small sample, but Shipley wasn't overly effective (2.7 YPC), which aligns with his underwhelming collegiate efficiency. Still, with Gainwell now in Pittsburgh, Shipley has an opportunity to lock down one of the league's best insurance jobs. Should Barkley miss time, the 23-year-old would likely see enough work behind an elite line in a high-scoring offense to allow RB2/flex production. Shipley makes for a fine late-round dart throw."

        "outlook_2025": "Smith was traded to the Steelers in June following a career year in Miami in which he finished top 5 among tight ends in targets, receptions, yards, fantasy points and touchdowns. This after never finishing better than 15th in the former four categories during his first seven NFL seasons. Smith's season actually started slowly (4.9 targets per game and one game with 12-plus fantasy points during Weeks 1-10), but he averaged 8.5 targets and a position-high 18.6 PPG from Week 11 on. Smith is now reunited with Arthur Smith, which isn't necisarily a good thing, as averaged single-digit fantay points during three prior seasons with Smith calling the plays. Pittsburgh is shaky at wideout, so Smith will play plenty, but his target ceiling is much lower with Pat Freiermuth also in the mix. Smith is best valued as a mid-to-back-end TE2."

Last season, he missed nine games and, while he did have a few solid outings (12-plus points three weeks in a row), he averaged a career-low 8.9 PPG on the season. With Tank Dell (knee) in doubt for 2025, Kirk will compete with rookies Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel for No. 2 receiver duties opposite Nico Collins, and he figures to work as the team's primary slot receiver. There's not much upside here (he's cleared six TDs once in his career), so Kirk should be viewed as no more than a late-round pick."

He peaked with a 59-674-8 receiving line in 2023 and has yet to post a top-45 fantasy season (PPG). The 25-year-old has minimal upside (zero top-10 fantasy outings last season) and substantial competition for targets, with rookies Matthew Golden and Savion Williams joining a WR group that also includes Jayden Reed, Dontayvion Wicks and eventually Christian Watson (ACL recovery).

Pacheco returned in Week 13 and then neither were viable fantasy options from that point forward, as they were near even in snaps, carries and targets, with Samaje Perine also in the mix as a passing-down specialist. Hunt was not particularly effective as a rusher or receiver and he's now 30 years old, so it's fair to expect a healthy Pacheco to lead this backfield in 2025.

That would've ranked 15th over the full season and is actually a slight step back from 17.4 in 2022 and 16.4 in 2023. The former No. 1 overall pick has yet to deliver a top-10 fantasy campaign (PPG) and that's despite finishing each of his first three NFL seasons in the top 10 among QBs in pass attempts, carries and rush yards. Lawrence is a solid player who adds just enough with his arm and legs to hang in the QB2 mix. His ceiling has obviously been low, but perhaps the presence of Brian Thomas Jr., Travis Hunter and new head coach Liam Coen can get him to the next level. He's a fine but unspectacular late-round pick."

He didn't run a ton, but was effective when he did (class-best 9.1 YPC and a ridiculous 79% of his 38 carries went for 5-plus yards). Ward is all but a lock to start in Week 1, and his supporting cast is serviceable, but there will be bumps along the way. So, unless he runs more than expected, he's unlikely to be more than an occasional streamer as a rookie. Consider him only as a late-round flier."

Though he did produce one rushing TD, he was (as expected) a nonfactor with his legs, totaling 11 yards on seven carries. Penix will benefit from a very good supporting cast led by Drake London and Bijan Robinson, but he'll be working in an offense that was third-run-heaviest in the league last season and he's unlikely to add much (if any) value with his legs. Penix should be viewed as no more than a late-round lottery ticket."

The 2023 sixth-round pick earned a significant offensive role early in his rookie season and took a slight leap forward last season, hitting career-best marks in targets, catches, yardage and TDs. One of the league's smallest receivers at 5-foot-8, 179 pounds, Douglas primarily works as a short-area slot receiver, which has severely limited his yardage, TDs and, of course, fantasy output. The 24-year-old has yet to deliver a top-55 fantasy campaign (PPG) and is a candidate for a lesser role in 2025 with Stefon Diggs and Kyle Williams in the mix on what is likely to be a run-first offense under Mike Vrabel. Douglas has minimal late-round appeal."

Things went very poorly in the final two stops, as he totaled three catches in five games. Johnson enters his age-29 season set to compete with Cedric Tillman for No. 2 WR duties behind Jerry Jeudy in an offense that has major question marks at quarterback. It's possible he could find his way back into the flex discussion (he finished in the top 40 in PPG four straight seasons from 2020 to 2023), but it's more likely his days of fantasy relevance are over."

That led to one big fantasy outing (12-11-73-0 in Week 15), but he otherwise averaged 6.9 fantasy PPG and failed to clear 12.4 points in any of the other seven games.

Taylor is one of the youngest (21) tight ends in this class and may require some development, but he's also well positioned for a sizable Year 1 role with Jeremy Ruckert as his top competition for the starting job, not to mention the Jets' lack of depth at wide receiver. It wouldn't be a shock if Taylor finished 2025 second to only Garrett Wilson in targets, so even in what will be a low-volume passing game with Justin Fields under center, Taylor is a fine late-round dart throw in deeper leagues."

His production was inconsistent, however, as 43% of his fantasy points came in three games and he had seven single-digit outings. He finished 39th or lower in snaps, routes, targets, catches, yards and fantasy PPG, so, if he's going to join the WR3/flex discussion, he'll need a volume boost in order to offset TD regression to the mean (4.8 xTD). That boost is unlikely, as he'll now have to battle Keenan Allen and rookie Tre Harris for work behind Ladd McConkey. Johnston is barely worth a late flier."

Corum wasn't overly impressive as a rookie, but he makes for an intriguing insurance stash, because Williams has totaled a massive 663 touches (third most) over the past two seasons, including the playoffs. Should Williams miss time, Corum would likely work ahead of rookie Jarquez Hunter as the lead back in a good Rams offense. He's worth a late-round flier."

The 2021 second-round pick peaked with an 11th-place finish in fantasy PPG in 2022 and, despite catching a career-high 65 passes and matching a career best with seven TDs last season, he ended up 14th in PPG. One concern here is that the TD output is unsustainable, as Freiermuth ranked 20th in expected TDs (3.1, which aligned with where he was when he scored two TDs in both 2022 and 2023) and had a career-low two end zone targets. Another concern is the acquisition of Jonnu Smith, who even in an offense short on WR depth, is sure to cut into Freiermuth's target share. The arrival of Aaron Rodgers helps his cause a bit, and he may settle in second in target priority behind DK Metcalf, but there's not much of a ceiling here. Freiermuth is a mid-to-back-end TE2."

He became a nonfactor near the goal line, totaling two end zone targets and two TDs, both of which are his fewest since taking on a regular offensive role in 2020. His history suggests a return to the fringe-TE1 mix is possible, and he could see a slight boost in targets with Christian Kirk and a pair of rookies set to replace Stefon Diggs (free agency) and Tank Dell (knee), but he also could lose work to second-year TE Cade Stover.

He has evolved into a solid, albeit conservative passer who adds some value with his legs.

That led to four games with 20-plus fantasy points. On the other hand, Richardson's poor passing may land him on the bench. He had fewer than 15 fantasy points in his other six outings, threw 12 INTs on the season (fourth most) and his 48% completion percentage ranked last. In total, he averaged 15.8 fantasy PPG in the 10 games, which would've ranked 15th over the full season.

Rarely utilized during his first two years with the Cowboys, Dowdle worked his way up to a backup role in 2023 before fending off Ezekiel Elliott for lead-back duties in 2024. He appeared in 16 games and ranked in the top 20 among backs in carries, rushing yards, receptions, touches and scrimmage yards. Dowdle found the end zone only five times in Dallas' struggling offense, however, which limited him to a 24th-place finish in fantasy points per game. The 27-year-old showed well in a tough situation, but he'll enter 2025 as a clear backup to Chuba Hubbard, with rookie Trevor Etienne also a threat for work. Dowdle has some deep-league insurance appeal, though he would max out as a RB2/flex even if called on to start."

The 2024 second-round pick found himself buried behind Michael Pittman Jr., Alec Pierce and Josh Downs for most of the season, which led to inconsistent usage and one outing with double-digit fantasy points. He was targeted often when on the field (54 targets on 193 routes), but his vertical role, coupled with poor QB play (league-high 41% off target rate), led to a position-worst 43% catch rate and zero TDs. Mitchell's second-round pedigree places him on the breakout radar, but his hands will be full overcoming the team's WR depth (all three of Pittman, Pierce and Downs are back) and ongoing QB question marks. Mitchell is no more than a late-round lottery ticket."

He went on to average 8.3 touches per game and score a total of two touchdowns in 26 outings prior to putting up a 116-yard, 2-TD showing with Hubbard sidelined last season. Perhaps that proves he still has some gas left in the tank, but now 28 years old and not much of a contributor as a pass catcher, it's unlikely Sanders will find his way to the fantasy radar.

Size (5-foot-8, 198 pounds) could limit his NFL workload ceiling, but Etienne has a three-down skill set and is one of the youngest backs in this class. He'll spend his rookie campaign developing behind lead back Chuba Hubbard and likely Rico Dowdle, and will eventually battle Hubbard and Jonathon Brooks for work in a suddenly crowded Carolina backfield. Etienne is worth rostering only in deep and dynasty leagues."

Despite the late-season boost, Gibson cleared 12 touches in only two games and never exceeded 12.2 fantasy points in a single game. The 27-year-old has seen his fantasy PPG mark dip each season of his career and hasn't finished better than 30th in the category since 2021. There's a new, run-friendly coaching staff in New England, but Gibson is now third on the depth chart behind Stevenson and second-round rookie TreVeyon Henderson. Gibson shouldn't be drafted."

That's no surprise and unlikely to change considering his 5-foot-8, 187-pound frame. Denver did take a look at him in an expanded role during his final four games of 2024 (10-plus touches in all four, including a career-high 18 in Week 18), but he failed to reach double-digit fantasy points in any of them, nor did he clear 12.6 points in any of his 16 games last season. The 24-year-old has some juice, but he's likely to remain a depth back behind newcomers J.K. Dobbins and RJ Henry and has minimal fantasy value."

He had a rough 2024 in tough circumstances (4.63 YPC, third worst in this class), but was much better as a rusher and receiver during a productive 2023 campaign. He's not super-fast or dynamic, but he's young and a solid producer. Gordon will battle Jaylen Wright for No. 2 duties behind De'Von Achane. He's a name to watch, but is a long shot for 2025 fantasy production."

Once the Jets acquired Davante Adams, however, Lazard's usage plummeted and he managed an 11-176-1 line (5.8 PPG) in his final six games. Lazard has a shot at No. 2 WR duties opposite Garrett Wilson this season, but with Rodgers out and dual-threat Justin Fields in at quarterback, there's almost no upside here. Lazard has never posted a top-30 fantasy campaign (one finish better than 47th) and he's unlikely to get there in his age-29 season."

He also led this class in YPR, YPT, RAC and adjusted catch rate for his career. Incredibly, Arroyo is charted as having zero career drops. The important context here is that Arroyo was a rarely used target (61 in 34 games, 47 of which came in 2024). He has long-term fantasy upside, but will open his career battling second-year A.J. Barner for work. Arroyo is the better pass-catching prospect of the two, so he's a sleeper to consider in the late rounds of deep leagues."

Gesicki was boom/bust (four games with 14-plus points, but 11 with 9 points or fewer), but he peaked late with position-best marks in targets (22), catches (18), receiving yards (154) and fantasy points (33.4) during Weeks 17 and 18.

Unsurprisingly, he didn't play much of a role initially, but he seemed back to his usual self in the playoff game against the Eagles, posting a 7-54-1 receiving line on 10 targets.

Even with a healthy Dak Prescott, Tolbert is a poor bet to come close to weekly flex production."

He had multiple TD passes in 12 games and had a solid fantasy floor with 16-plus points in 12 games. Despite the big box score numbers, Darnold finished \"only\" 18th in QBR and isn't going to move the needle much with his legs (career high in rush yards is 222), so it's fair to expect a step back in a Klint Kubiak-led offense that swapped out DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett for Cooper Kupp and Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Darnold is best valued as a fringe QB2 with minimal upside."

He's still able to put up passing numbers (top 8 in attempts, yards and TDs last season), but is a nonfactor with his legs (107 rushing yards last season was actually his highest since 2020).

Following Derek Carr's shocking retirement in May, Shough is likely to slide in as the Saints' starting quarterback. Even if he wins that job and despite a decent WR trio (Chris Olave, Rashid Shaheed, Brandin Cooks), Shough is unlikely to emerge as a consistent fantasy option in an offense that is expected to struggle in 2025.

Primarily a short-range (8.0 aDOT) slot receiver (71%), Noel also worked as a kick and punt returner at Iowa State. Even with Tank Dell unlikely to play this season, Noel will need to battle Christian Kirk, Justin Watson and second-round rookie Jayden Higgins for work behind Nico Collins.

He is 5-foot-8 with the shortest arms in this RB class and he didn't show too well at the combine, running a 4.60 40 and tying for the shortest broad jump (117). His collegiate stats are underwhelming for the most part, though some of that seems to be team-related, as his 1.52 yards before contact across 47 games is lowest in this class, whereas he was solid in YAC (3.30) and forced missed tackle rate (4.2). Monangai will open his career behind D'Andre Swift and Roschon Johnson, so he's well off the fantasy radar."

The fantasy output wasn't great in the Giants' punchless offense, but the increase in reliance is notable and it will only help having Russell Wilson under center.

He did find the end zone six times in 16 games, but a lack of volume allowed him only 6.5 fantasy PPG after the season opener. Playing behind (or alongside) Mark Andrews the past three years, Likely has yet to finish a season among the top 20 tight ends in snaps, routes, targets, catches or yardage. His 20th-place finish in fantasy PPG last season was a career best. Perhaps Likely's best days are ahead of him, but consistent fantasy value is a long shot as long as Andrews is on the roster.

After throwing 24 touchdowns in 13 games as a rookie, Jones totaled 45 pass TDs in 57 games the following five seasons. He finished one season better than 15th in fantasy PPG and that eighth-place finish in 2022 was primarily a product of big-time rushing (120-708-7). The 28-year-old isn't going to move the needle as a passer, but if he wins the Colts' gig, he could land on the streaming radar due to his legs (60-plus carries in four of the last five seasons). Even if he beats out Richardson, he'll only be a fringe QB2 and only worth drafting in superflex."

Bowers actually played a pretty healthy share of the snaps (63%, including 74% from Week 14 on) last season, but he was targeted more than four times in only one of 11 games, which also marked his only game over 6.1 fantasy points.

The team likely still views Sinnott as its tight end of the future, but he's not the tight end of the present, as Ertz was signed to an extension during the offseason and Bates is also back. Perhaps the 22-year-old can overtake Ertz at some point this season, but that's not enough incentive to roster him anywhere except in dynasty leagues."

Instead, he finished 30th in QBR, paced the NFL with 16 INTs and continued to add nothing with his legs (zero yards on 23 carries). Cousins managed three weekly finishes better than 15th prior to being benched for Michael Penix Jr. in Week 16.

In what was a bit of a bizarre season, Kmet appeared in all 17 games, paced all tight ends in snaps, finished fifth in routes and led the position with an 84% catch rate, but ended up 27th in fantasy PPG. He had two games with double-digit targets but three with zero. The 26-year-old's fantasy stock took a massive hit in April when Chicago spent its first-round pick on Colston Loveland.

Of course, after backing up Aaron Rodgers last season, Taylor will serve the same role behind newcomer Justin Fields in 2025. Taylor only attempted 22 passes last season and has averaged 68.7 attempts per season since 2018, maxing out with 180 in 2023. Taylor still adds a little bit of value with his legs and that helped him to three 17-plus fantasy point showings in four full games back in 2023. The 36-year-old is not worth your attention on draft day and, if called on to start, will be no more than a back-end QB2."

Rudolph was not particularly effective and his 6.7 YPA and 64% completion percentage on 228 attempts last season exactly mirror his career rates. The 30-year-old will back up Aaron Rodgers this season and, even with DK Metcalf, Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth at his disposal, won't be a fantasy option even if asked to make a few starts."

Minshew has yet to play a full regular season and his best fantasy campaign was a 19th-place finish in 2019 (he was 13th on a per-game basis in 2020, but only appeared in nine games). Minshew played in 10 games with the Raiders last season, but threw more INTs (10) than touchdowns (nine) and eventually lost his starting job to Aidan O'Connell. Minshew is well off the fantasy radar and would only join the QB2 conversation if Mahomes were to miss time."

The result was what you expect from Winston, as he had his share of big plays (both good and bad) and ended up with 12 pass TDs and 12 INTs. Winston is likely to back up Russell Wilson and perhaps rookie Jaxson Dart this season. If called upon to start, he may add some big-play opportunities for the team's pass catchers, but will be no more than a desperation streaming option in deep leagues."

That didn't slow him from a huge workload at Stanford, as he handled a 32% target share and 47% air yard share (second highest in this class) last season. His efficiency was mostly below average, but there's potential here. Ayomanor will begin his career behind Calvin Ridley, Tyler Lockett and perhaps Van Jefferson, Treylon Burks and fellow rookie Chimere Dike. Ayomanor is only worth drafting in dynasty."

He had a huge 2024 at Maryland (96-1,124-9 receiving line, 31% target share), but his efficiency was average, at best, both last season and for his career. He'll battle for a backup role behind Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison and isn't on the 2025 fantasy radar."

Wicks handled a healthy 22% target share (6.6 per game), but wasn't overly productive. After a strong 5-78-2 showing on 13 targets (24.8 fantasy points) in Week 4, he failed to clear seven targets, five receptions, 49 yards or 9.9 fantasy points in any of the other six outings. Even with Christian Watson likely to miss all or most of 2025, Wicks will have his hands full finding reps with Matthew Golden, Doubs, Jayden Reed and Savion Williams also on the roster.

In addition to his 87 targets, Williams posted a 51-322-6 rushing line in 2024. He ran a strong 4.48 40 and has the potential to emerge as a multi-faceted (rusher, receiver, returner) asset in the pros. Williams' path to consistent targets in 2025 is tricky, as Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed and fellow rookie Matthew Golden headline the depth chart.

He dropped nine of his 76 targets last season, though his career 16.0 aDOT tops this class. Smith is a long shot for consistent fantasy value in the Jets' low-volume passing game, but he has a path to snaps with Allen Lazard, Josh Reynolds and Malachi Corley as his top competition behind Garrett Wilson."

He showed well at the combine, though, including a 4.43 40 at 214 pounds. TeSlaa will operate as a depth receiver behind Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams and perhaps Tim Patrick and Kalif Raymond this season. He's only worth rostering in dynasty."

It was a solid rebound after substantial missed action in 2022 (broken foot) and 2023 (torn ACL). Evans ran a solid 4.74 40-yard dash at 258 pounds at the combine.

Barkley, who averaged a career-best 5.8 YPC, does carry some risk, though, as he enters his age-28 campaign off a season with an absurd 482 touches (including the playoffs). He'll need to sustain his elite rushing output, as he isn't a big factor in the passing game (outside the top 25 in targets, catches and yards).

In his prime at age 26, Lamb remains one of the league's best receivers and he will get Prescott back this season.

That said, with Cooper Kupp out and Davante Adams in, Nacua remains well positioned for a massive target share in a good Rams offense that has led the NFL in WR targets each of the last two seasons.

Jacobs also contributed in the passing game (15th among RBs in receiving yards) and has now finished all six NFL seasons 18th or better in fantasy PPG. Green Bay's feature back remains in his prime at age 27 and makes for a solid fantasy RB1.",

The dual-threat playmaker was productive as a passer and even better as a rusher, ranking no lower than third among QBs in carries, rushing yards, rush TDs, carries inside the 5 and scrambles. Daniels produced 355.8 fantasy points, which trails only Cam Newton (370.3) for most by a rookie. He showed a high ceiling, having delivered 24-plus points in eight games, including his final five full regular-season outings). Entering Year 2 with an even better supporting cast that now includes Deebo Samuel Sr. and Laremy Tunsil, Daniels has a strong case to be the first QB off the board in fantasy drafts.",

The 2023 first-round pick got more downfield opportunities in 2024 than he did as a rookie and perhaps will get even more in 2025 with DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett out and Cooper Kupp in as his wide receiver running mate. Smith-Njigba will also have a new playcaller (Klint Kubiak) and quarterback (Sam Darnold), which adds some uncertainty, but the bottom line is he's an emerging star and, at 23 years old, younger than some incoming rookies.

He ran well (4.8 YPC) and was busy near the goal line (he ranked fifth with 17 carries inside the 5-yard line), but he struggled as a receiver (RB-worst 3.2 YPT).

Hall remained a clear lead back (only four RBs played more snaps) and was a force as a receiver (top 5 in routes, targets, catches and yards for the second season in a row), but pedestrian efficiency and rushing volume kept him outside the top 12 RBs in touches, yards and TDs. Hall is a good back and in his prime at age 24, so there's certainly so post-hype appeal in a new scheme with Justin Fields in at quarterback, but it's also likely that he'll share more work with Braelon Allen.

Harrison scored eight TDs, but finished 37th in catches and 30th in both yards and fantasy points (41st in PPG). There's some obvious risk here, but Harrison was drafted with the expectation he'd be an elite player and it's only logical that he'll be treated that way in terms of usage in his second season.

Odunze had some poor scoring luck (three TDs, 6.7 expected), which was partially to blame for him scoring single-digit fantasy points in 13 of 17 games. There are a lot of mouths to feed in Chicago, but with Caleb Williams entering Year 2 and Ben Johnson now running the offense, Odunze is an extremely logical breakout candidate. He should be one of your favorite midround targets.",

He has been an elite fantasy contributor in years past (he was No. 1 in PPG in both 2021 and 2022), but durability has been an issue (two full seasons in his career and exactly five missed games each of the past two years) and he's now 32 years old. Kupp remained a good fantasy contributor during most of last season (18.4 PPG in his first nine games), but it's concerning how quickly he faded down the stretch (4.9 PPG in his final five outings). Perhaps Kupp has one more big season left, and there are plenty of targets available opposite Jaxon Smith-Njigba, but there is certainly risk here. He's best viewed as a flex.",

He finished the regular season sixth in pass attempts, completions and pass TDs, as well as fifth among QBs in carries.

After debuting in Week 7, Pearsall had a few strong fantasy outings (17-plus points in three games), but was otherwise a nonfactor (3.6 PPG in the other eight games). The 2024 first-round pick finished strong (8-141-1 and 6-69-1 receiving lines in Weeks 17 and 18, respectively) and now has a much clearer path to consistent work with Deebo Samuel Sr. gone and Brandon Aiyuk (ACL) expected to miss part of the season. There are still plenty of mouths to feed in San Francisco, but Pearsall very well could lead this team in targets. He's well worth a midround flier.",

Coleman was on the field quite a bit (73% snap share) and started to pick up steam around midseason (consecutive games with at least seven targets and 16 fantasy points), but a wrist injury then cost him four games and he went without a 12-point outing from that point forward (including three playoff games). Coleman's role as a vertical target (his 15.0 aDOT ranked fifth) allowed him many big plays (his 19.2 YPR ranked third), but major volatility (51% catch rate). Coleman was a young rookie at age 21 and showed enough flashes to suggest a Year 2 breakout is possible, especially in a Josh Allen-led offense with Khalil Shakir and Joshua Palmer as his top competition. Coleman is well worth a mid-to-late-round pick.",

Arguably the team's No. 1 WR to that point, Shaheed paced the Saints in targets (6.8 per game) and had also produced 29 yards on six carries. His 13.3 fantasy PPG ranked 34th among WRs and he hit the 15-point mark in four of his six games. One of the game's top deep threats and a contributor as a rusher and returner, Shaheed very well could find his way to weekly fantasy relevance in a similar way as Deebo Samuel Sr., albeit with more vertical work. Of course, he's yet to show that level of production over a full season and he'll need to fend off Chris Olave, Alvin Kamara and now Brandin Cooks for work in an offense that will have rookie QB Tyler Shough under center. Shaheed is a fine late-round lottery ticket.",

Also a rushing and return threat, Egbuka will have a role right out of the gate, but just how sizable it is will depend on the health of Chris Godwin (ankle).

The 2020 first-round pick played well last season (sixth in QBR) despite battling injury issues, but he wasn't much of a fantasy option. He came out strong with a pair of top-3 fantasy outings in his first four games, but had no additional weekly finishes better than 10th for the season. Love was a nonfactor with his legs (83 rushing yards in 15 games) and, after totaling 15 pass TDs in his first five games, threw only 10 in his final 10 outings. Green Bay did score an unusually high percentage of its offensive TDs on the ground (46%, the second highest for a Matt LaFleur offense), but that may not change with Josh Jacobs back in 2025. Love ran more in 2023 and was a solid fantasy starter, so, especially with a better supporting cast led by first-round WR Matthew Golden, there's hope for a rebound, but it is safer to view him as a QB2.",

With Ben Johnson leading the offense, Goff has finished sixth or better in passing yards and TDs each of the last three seasons, but he adds almost nothing with his legs (150 yards and two TDs total during the three seasons). Even during a productive 2024, Goff was inconsistent, as he posted eight top-10 fantasy weeks but was 17th or worse the other nine weeks. Especially with Johnson off to Chicago, Goff is likely to see some regression in key efficiency categories (his 72% completion rate and 8.6 YPA last season were way above his previous career highs) and, coupled with his lack of rushing, he has a very low fantasy ceiling. Goff will remain a productive passer, but he's no more than a QB2 with occasional streaming appeal.",

Blue's workload was limited in crowded Texas RB rooms (214 carries in three years), but he was an effective rusher (his 3.83 career YAC is fifth best in this class) and he showed his receiving chops with a 42-368-6 receiving line in 2024. He's a bit on the small side (196 pounds) and has had fumble issues, but ran a strong 4.38 40 at the combine. Blue may open his career behind veterans Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders, but neither have played well in recent seasons so this depth chart is wide open. Blue will be on the RB2/flex radar if he wins the lead-back job, so he should be on your radar in the late rounds.",

He is as durable as they come, as he's the only tailback who has appeared in 100% of his team's games over the past four seasons. He has yet to finish a season lower than seventh in the league in carries (255-plus each season), but that figures to change this season with first-round rookie Omarion Hampton likely to handle lead-back duties in Los Angeles. Harris also figures to be very limited as a receiver, as Jim Harbaugh and Greg Roman have a long history of low RB usage in the pass game, in addition to the fact Harris has finished outside the top 20 RBs in targets each of the past two seasons. Harris has ranked in the 20-to-30 range in fantasy PPG each of the past three seasons, but even if he splits carries with Hampton, he'll be hard-pressed to produce consistent flex numbers.",

Tuten is fast, tough and has three-down ability, though his Year 1 opportunity is unclear with Travis Etienne Jr. and Tank Bigsby also on the depth chart.

        "outlook_2025": "McMillan enters his second NFL season as a bit of a tricky evaluation. The 2024 third-round pick opened his rookie season as a de facto full-time player, but was rarely targeted behind Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. He was finally featured during the final five regular-season games and exploded for a league-high seven TD catches (at least one in all five outings) and 19.8 fantasy PPG (at least 16.7 points in all five). Of course, Godwin was out during that stretch and, even if he misses some time in 2025, the team drafted Emeka Egbuka in the first round of April's draft. Consistent fantasy production will be hard for McMillan to find with Evans, Godwin and Egbuka in the mix, so he'll be only a deep-league flex option if Godwin is sidelined. McMillan is only worth a late-round flier.",

The 25-year-old was effective as both a rusher and receiver and, as we saw in a small sample last season, he'd likely be Buffalo's lead back (with Johnson also plenty involved) in the event of a Cook injury.

Still, with Gainwell now in Pittsburgh, Shipley has an opportunity to lock down one of the league's best insurance jobs.

Last season, he missed nine games and, while he did have a few solid outings (12-plus points three weeks in a row), he averaged a career-low 8.9 PPG on the season. With Tank Dell (knee) in doubt for 2025, Kirk will compete with rookies Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel for No. 2 receiver duties opposite Nico Collins, and he figures to work as the team's primary slot receiver. There's not much upside here (he's cleared six TDs once in his career), so Kirk should be viewed as no more than a late-round pick.",

Lawrence is a solid player who adds just enough with his arm and legs to hang in the QB2 mix. His ceiling has obviously been low, but perhaps the presence of Brian Thomas Jr., Travis Hunter and new head coach Liam Coen can get him to the next level.

Ward tossed a class-high 39 TDs and his 88.7 QBR trailed only Will Howard last season -- his lone year at Miami. He didn't run a ton, but was effective when he did (class-best 9.1 YPC and a ridiculous 79% of his 38 carries went for 5-plus yards). Ward is all but a lock to start in Week 1, and his supporting cast is serviceable, but there will be bumps along the way. So, unless he runs more than expected, he's unlikely to be more than an occasional streamer as a rookie. Consider him only as a late-round flier.",

One of the league's smallest receivers at 5-foot-8, 179 pounds, Douglas primarily works as a short-area slot receiver, which has severely limited his yardage, TDs and, of course, fantasy output. The 24-year-old has yet to deliver a top-55 fantasy campaign (PPG) and is a candidate for a lesser role in 2025 with Stefon Diggs and Kyle Williams in the mix on what is likely to be a run-first offense under Mike Vrabel.

Johnson enters his age-29 season set to compete with Cedric Tillman for No. 2 WR duties behind Jerry Jeudy in an offense that has major question marks at quarterback.

He finished 39th or lower in snaps, routes, targets, catches, yards and fantasy PPG, so, if he's going to join the WR3/flex discussion, he'll need a volume boost in order to offset TD regression to the mean (4.8 xTD).

In fact, Thornton was used sparingly throughout his four collegiate seasons, totaling a 6.1% target share (second lowest in this WR class) and 65-1,426-10 receiving line. He posted the best speed score (120) among WRs at the combine (4.30 40 at 6-foot-4, 205 pounds).

The 2021 second-round pick peaked with an 11th-place finish in fantasy PPG in 2022 and, despite catching a career-high 65 passes and matching a career best with seven TDs last season, he ended up 14th in PPG. One concern here is that the TD output is unsustainable, as Freiermuth ranked 20th in expected TDs (3.1, which aligned with where he was when he scored two TDs in both 2022 and 2023) and had a career-low two end zone targets. Another concern is the acquisition of Jonnu Smith, who even in an offense short on WR depth, is sure to cut into Freiermuth's target share. The arrival of Aaron Rodgers helps his cause a bit, and he may settle in second in target priority behind DK Metcalf, but there's not much of a ceiling here. Freiermuth is a mid-to-back-end TE2.",

He became a nonfactor near the goal line, totaling two end zone targets and two TDs, both of which are his fewest since taking on a regular offensive role in 2020. His history suggests a return to the fringe-TE1 mix is possible, and he could see a slight boost in targets with Christian Kirk and a pair of rookies set to replace Stefon Diggs (free agency) and Tank Dell (knee), but he also could lose work to second-year TE Cade Stover.

Rarely utilized during his first two years with the Cowboys, Dowdle worked his way up to a backup role in 2023 before fending off Ezekiel Elliott for lead-back duties in 2024. He appeared in 16 games and ranked in the top 20 among backs in carries, rushing yards, receptions, touches and scrimmage yards. Dowdle found the end zone only five times in Dallas' struggling offense, however, which limited him to a 24th-place finish in fantasy points per game. The 27-year-old showed well in a tough situation, but he'll enter 2025 as a clear backup to Chuba Hubbard, with rookie Trevor Etienne also a threat for work. Dowdle has some deep-league insurance appeal, though he would max out as a RB2/flex even if called on to start.",

He was targeted often when on the field (54 targets on 193 routes), but his vertical role, coupled with poor QB play (league-high 41% off target rate), led to a position-worst 43% catch rate and zero TDs. Mitchell's second-round pedigree places him on the breakout radar, but his hands will be full overcoming the team's WR depth (all three of Pittman, Pierce and Downs are back) and ongoing QB question marks.

Once the Jets acquired Davante Adams, however, Lazard's usage plummeted and he managed an 11-176-1 line (5.8 PPG) in his final six games. Lazard has a shot at No. 2 WR duties opposite Garrett Wilson this season, but with Rodgers out and dual-threat Justin Fields in at quarterback, there's almost no upside here.

The important context here is that Arroyo was a rarely used target (61 in 34 games, 47 of which came in 2024). He has long-term fantasy upside, but will open his career battling second-year A.J.

Despite the generous playing time in the league's pass-heaviest offense, as well as several missed games by Tee Higgins, Iosivas cleared five targets only twice (Weeks 1 and 3) and averaged just 7.1 fantasy PPG. The 25-year-old finished last among 88 qualified wide receivers in YPRR (0.9) and, even if he fends off second-year Jermaine Burton for No. 3 duties, he'll be a minimal threat for consistent targets. Iosivas shouldn't be drafted.",

He did find the end zone six times in 16 games, but a lack of volume allowed him only 6.5 fantasy PPG after the season opener. Playing behind (or alongside) Mark Andrews the past three years, Likely has yet to finish a season among the top 20 tight ends in snaps, routes, targets, catches or yardage.

Sanders will be a candidate for more work in his second season, but he's still very young (22) and will continue to share work with Tremble.

Conklin has proven reliable (he's missed two games in his career) but he's not targeted quite enough, nor does he score enough touchdowns (11 in seven seasons) to allow starter-level production in fantasy.

He was also limited as a receiver and underwhelmed at the combine, including a 4.55 40-yard dash, 1.62 10-yard split and 117-inch broad jump (the latter two tied for worst in this RB class).

The veteran quarterback entered the 2024 season with high expectations after he had finished his prior six full seasons in the top 10 in pass TDs, as well as seven of his prior nine full seasons in the top 12 in fantasy points per game. Instead, he finished 30th in QBR, paced the NFL with 16 INTs and continued to add nothing with his legs (zero yards on 23 carries). Cousins managed three weekly finishes better than 15th prior to being benched for Michael Penix Jr. in Week 16. Perhaps Cousins will bounce back now that he's more than one year removed from Achilles surgery, but considering he's now 37 years old, it's unlikely he'll find his way back into the QB1 mix.",

He handled 20% of the Orange's targets during the 36 games he was active and his career 10.76 aDOT was the second highest in this TE class.

Minshew has yet to play a full regular season and his best fantasy campaign was a 19th-place finish in 2019 (he was 13th on a per-game basis in 2020, but only appeared in nine games). Minshew played in 10 games with the Raiders last season, but threw more INTs (10) than touchdowns (nine) and eventually lost his starting job to Aidan O'Connell.

He can align all over the formation and showed well at the combine (4.34 40), but may be destined for backup WR and special teams work. He'll battle the likes of Van Jefferson, Treylon Burks and fellow fourth-round rookie Elic Ayomanor for snaps behind Calvin Ridley and Tyler Lockett this season.

In addition to his 87 targets, Williams posted a 51-322-6 rushing line in 2024. He ran a strong 4.48 40 and has the potential to emerge as a multi-faceted (rusher, receiver, returner) asset in the pros.

Despite resting at times (including all of Week 18), Barkley led the NFL in carries, touches and scrimmage yards, which led to a position-best 22.2 fantasy PPG. Barkley, who averaged a career-best 5.8 YPC, does carry some risk, though, as he enters his age-28 campaign off a season with an absurd 482 touches (including the playoffs). He'll need to sustain his elite rushing output, as he isn't a big factor in the passing game (outside the top 25 in targets, catches and yards). He nonetheless remains in a great spot behind the Eagles' terrific offensive line and should be off the board in the first round of fantasy drafts."

That said, with Cooper Kupp out and Davante Adams in, Nacua remains well positioned for a massive target share in a good Rams offense that has led the NFL in WR targets each of the last two seasons.

Thomas' volume will need to increase in Year 2 in order to sustain WR1 fantasy production and, while it's reasonable to expect that boost, it's worth noting he had six 10-plus target games with backup Mac Jones (22.9 fantasy PPG those six weeks) but zero with starter Trevor Lawrence (14.4). The bottom line is Thomas appears to be the real deal and, even with Travis Hunter added to the mix, he has a path to a massive target share in a Liam Coen scheme that was extremely generous to Tampa Bay's wide receivers. Thomas is a good back-end WR1 target."

He was a featured player right out of the gate and went on to pace the position in routes, targets, receptions (112 is the most ever by a rookie, regardless of position), yards and fantasy points. Bowers' season could've been even better had he seen more goal-line work (he was limited to five TDs and six end zone targets). He is already an elite player and the 22-year-old figures to benefit from improved QB play now that Geno Smith is under center. Bowers should be one of the first two TEs off the board on draft day."

Hill finished 31st among WRs in fantasy PPG after ranking no lower than 11th the prior seven seasons. It didn't help that Tua Tagovailoa missed six games (Hill averaged 9.0 PPG in those weeks), but he wasn't his usual, elite self even with Tagovailoa (14.9 PPG). Hill was the No. 2 fantasy WR three of four seasons before the 2024 dud, so a potential rebound season is worth factoring in, but it's not a lock as he enters his age-31 campaign.

The only 'knock' on Jackson that is relative to other top fantasy QBs is rushing TDs (he has 14 total over the last four seasons and had zero carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line last season), but he does more than enough otherwise to provide elite fantasy output.

The dual-threat playmaker was productive as a passer and even better as a rusher, ranking no lower than third among QBs in carries, rushing yards, rush TDs, carries inside the 5 and scrambles. Daniels produced 355.8 fantasy points, which trails only Cam Newton (370.3) for most by a rookie. He showed a high ceiling, having delivered 24-plus points in eight games, including his final five full regular-season outings). Entering Year 2 with an even better supporting cast that now includes Deebo Samuel Sr. and Laremy Tunsil, Daniels has a strong case to be the first QB off the board in fantasy drafts."

On the other, he's an explosive playmaker (4.87 YPC) in an elite offense who tied for the NFL lead 16 rushing touchdowns in 16 regular season games last season. Cook is obviously a strong bet for touchdown regression to the mean (especially considering he had nine TDs during his first two seasons), but the 25-year-old gets enough run in a great offense to produce starting-caliber fantasy numbers.

The 2023 first-round pick got more downfield opportunities in 2024 than he did as a rookie and perhaps will get even more in 2025 with DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett out and Cooper Kupp in as his wide receiver running mate. Smith-Njigba will also have a new playcaller (Klint Kubiak) and quarterback (Sam Darnold), which adds some uncertainty, but the bottom line is he's an emerging star and, at 23 years old, younger than some incoming rookies.

Despite the success, there is some 'sustainability' concern here, as McLaurin's volume didn't change much from years past and he finished outside the top 30 in routes and target share. He's finished exactly 19th among WRs in targets three seasons in a row and has never finished higher than 15th in catches or ninth in yards. McLaurin will require a boost in usage to offset TD regression to the mean in order to sustain WR1 numbers. He's best valued as a mid-to-back-end WR2."

He finished sixth or better among WRs in targets all three seasons, but has yet to finish a season better than 20th in fantasy PPG due to underwhelming TD totals (14 in 51 games). Wilson's assured of a hefty target share, which will keep him fantasy-relevant, but his overall volume may suffer with dual-threat Justin Fields now under center.

Appearing in 14 games, Kamara soaked up 228 carries (12 off his career high) and led all backs in targets. He has yet to finish a season lower than fifth among RBs in targets, or lower than ninth in catches and receiving yards. That has translated in fantasy, as he's finished eighth or better in fantasy PPG in seven of his eight seasons. On the concerning side is durability, as Kamara hasn't played a full regular season since his rookie year (2017) and is now 30 years old. Additionally, the Saints' offense figures to struggle following Derek Carr's retirement. Kamara's clear path to touches and elite receiving work keeps him in the fringe RB1 discussion, but there's obvious risk here."

He ran well (4.8 YPC) and was busy near the goal line (he ranked fifth with 17 carries inside the 5-yard line), but he struggled as a receiver (RB-worst 3.2 YPT).

Hall remained a clear lead back (only four RBs played more snaps) and was a force as a receiver (top 5 in routes, targets, catches and yards for the second season in a row), but pedestrian efficiency and rushing volume kept him outside the top 12 RBs in touches, yards and TDs. Hall is a good back and in his prime at age 24, so there's certainly so post-hype appeal in a new scheme with Justin Fields in at quarterback, but it's also likely that he'll share more work with Braelon Allen. Hall is best as a mid-range RB2."

Incredibly, Evans has never finished a season worse than 23rd in fantasy points (26th in PPG).

He also benefited massively from Chris Godwin's season-ending injury, averaging 6.3 targets and 13.6 fantasy PPG with him, but 9.1 targets and 20.7 PPG without. Despite the concerns, Evans hasn't shown signs of slowing down and has a good QB in Baker Mayfield. He's a fringe fantasy WR2."

Harrison scored eight TDs, but finished 37th in catches and 30th in both yards and fantasy points (41st in PPG). There's some obvious risk here, but Harrison was drafted with the expectation he'd be an elite player and it's only logical that he'll be treated that way in terms of usage in his second season. If that happens, the sky is the limit in terms of fantasy production. There's some projection here, but Harrison should be valued as a fringe WR2."

Moore did improve dramatically in the second half of the season (11.1 fantasy PPG during Weeks 1-10, but 17.3 in eight games once OC Shane Waldron was fired), which is notable as Ben Johnson takes over the offense.

In three full games last season, he handled a massive 36% target share (10.7 per game) and averaged 21.6 PPG (17-plus in all three). On the other hand, Rice tore his LCL in Week 3, is facing a potential suspension and, even when active, he now has legitimate target competition via Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown and Travis Kelce. The good news is that 25-year-old Rice is expected to be fully healthy prior to Week 1 and will be a featured target when on the field.

He was involved as both a rusher and receiver, dominating with the ball in his hands (his 7.0 RAC was ninth best among WRs). Perhaps the most notable nugget pertaining to Worthy is his late-season emergence. He handled a hefty 26% target share (8.7 per game) in his final six games (including the playoffs) and scored at least 19 fantasy points in five of those games. Working with a QB (Patrick Mahomes) who has finished top 10 in passing yards and TDs seven straight years, as well as with Travis Kelce aging and Rashee Rice facing a possible suspension after missing most of 2024, the 22-year-old Worthy is well positioned for a big breakout. He's an intriguing WR2 target."

Incredibly, Swift has now finished between 15th and 21st among RBs in fantasy points in all five NFL seasons.

Ridley has finished one season better than 18th in fantasy PPG (two better than 24th) and, while his positioning atop the depth chart in Tennessee keeps him in the WR3/flex mix, his upside will be determined by the play of No. 1 pick Cam Ward."

Perhaps the change of scenery will get him to the next level, as he's thus far been an exciting playmaker but not yet a consistent fantasy option. Pickens handled a career-high 26% target share (15th among WRs) last season, but he missed three games and found the end zone only three times despite seeing 12 end zone targets (12th most). Pickens has finished 37th or worse in fantasy PPG all three seasons while playing a volatile field-stretcher role (top 15 in aDOT all three years). He will certainly benefit from improved QB play (Dak Prescott), but he now has legitimate target competition from CeeDee Lamb. We likely haven't seen Pickens' best work, but there's enough uncertainty here that the 24-year-old should be valued as a midrange WR3."

Mahomes has evolved into a quarterback who still attempts a ton of passes (exactly third in pass attempts four years in a row), but is more conservative (career-low 6.4 aDOT and 6.8 YPA in 2024) and doesn't throw as many TDs as in years past (26 last season was his fewest since 2019). Perhaps he'll rebound a bit in that area with the Xavier Worthy/Rashee Rice/Hollywood Brown trio together, but in the meantime Mahomes adds just enough with his legs (between 300 and 400 yards five seasons in a row) to keep him in the fantasy starter conversation."

Odunze had some poor scoring luck (three TDs, 6.7 expected), which was partially to blame for him scoring single-digit fantasy points in 13 of 17 games. There are a lot of mouths to feed in Chicago, but with Caleb Williams entering Year 2 and Ben Johnson now running the offense, Odunze is an extremely logical breakout candidate. He should be one of your favorite midround targets."

Pollard reached 19 fantasy points only once (Spears was out that week) and has finished just one season in his career better than 22nd in fantasy PPG (2022 in Dallas). Entering his age-28 season, Pollard is again expected to lead Tennessee's run game, but Spears will be involved, especially in passing situations. Pollard is a low-ceiling flex."

Size and age (24) concerns aside, he showed well at the combine, including a 4.40 40, 38-inch vertical and 127-inch broad jump. Harvey's landing spot is very good, as fellow newcomer J.K. Dobbins is his primary competition for work. The duo may split carries, but Harvey is a good bet to emerge as the primary receiving back, which is notable in a Sean Payton offense that often leans heavily on RBs in the passing game. Harvey is a fringe RB2 target, but there's upside for even more."

In his seven games, the veteran receiver averaged 19.7 fantasy PPG and caught 79% of his passes, both of which ranked second at the position. Perhaps most notably, Godwin scored five TDs in seven games, which was somewhat unsustainable (2.1 xTD) but nonetheless a step forward after he totaled 10 TDs the prior three seasons (46 games). Godwin is still in his prime at age 29 and now seemingly Baker Mayfield's top target, but it's unclear if he'll be healthy to begin the 2025 season. If he is, he's well positioned for a big comeback season and on the WR1 radar. If not, he'll make for more of a midround lottery ticket."

He handled a 24% target share, which wasn't far off his 27% and 25% rates during his first two seasons. The 2022 first-round pick has yet to reach his ceiling (he's yet to clear five TDs in a season), but he produced top-25 fantasy campaigns in his first two seasons and is set up well to pace New Orleans in targets in 2025. Of course, there's added risk here as the Saints turn to rookie QB Tyler Shough following Derek Carr's retirement. Olave is safest as a WR3/flex, with a hint of post-hype sleeper appeal."

Kupp remained a good fantasy contributor during most of last season (18.4 PPG in his first nine games), but it's concerning how quickly he faded down the stretch (4.9 PPG in his final five outings). Perhaps Kupp has one more big season left, and there are plenty of targets available opposite Jaxon Smith-Njigba, but there is certainly risk here. He's best viewed as a flex."

That led to boom/bust production last season, as he scored 43% of his fantasy points in three games and was held to single digits in seven of 15 outings. Addison is suspended three games to begin the 2025 season, but once he's on the field, he will continue battling for looks with Justin Jefferson and T.J. Hockenson.

The de facto Najee Harris replacement in run-heavy Pittsburgh, Johnson is a flex option who figures to max out as a fringe RB2."

Andrews has always been extremely efficient when targeted (he's never finished lower than fifth in YPRR), but he's also never been quite as TD dependent (11 TDs in 2024 were a career high and his 16.2% TD rate was way above his prior career rate of 7.1%).

By season's end, he was 10th among QBs in fantasy PPG, which was a slight dip from his eighth-place finish in 2023.

The 26-year-old has missed two-plus games in all three pro seasons and has yet to finish better than 24th among backs in snaps, touches or yards. He's a flex option with more value in non-PPR."

The 27-year-old figures to benefit from the team's coaching change, as all six of Mike Vrabel's Titans offenses were run-heavy.

Dobbins missed four games (he's yet to play a full season), but he still managed 1,058 yards and nine TDs. He's now 26 years old and is expected to team up with second-round rookie RJ Harvey.

Shakir finished 35th in fantasy PPG and had little upside (his best weekly finish was 10th). He handled a 23% target share (an appealing number in a great offense), but most of it is in the short area (29% of his targets were screens) and he simply doesn't get much run near the goal line (seven career TDs and five career end zone targets).

Durability has been an issue, as he's yet to play a full regular season. With Terry McLaurin as his only notable target competition, Samuel has a path to similar usage to what he saw in San Francisco.

Coleman's role as a vertical target (his 15.0 aDOT ranked fifth) allowed him many big plays (his 19.2 YPR ranked third), but major volatility (51% catch rate).

He averaged a healthy 27% target share in 10 full games with Anthony Richardson, but that resulted in an ugly 39-428-0 receiving line on 65 targets. He averaged 8.0 fantasy PPG, reaching double digits once (15.6 in Week 12). Pittman continues to struggle to find the end zone (his career high is six and he's had four or fewer three seasons in a row) and that may not change with Richardson under center (the Colts had eight pass TDs in his 10 games last season). As good a player as Pittman is, Richardson's presence will limit his fantasy output and life may not be much better if Daniel Jones is under center. Pittman is a flex option."

Reed has struggled with drops (eight last season), but he's otherwise been productive (11.4 YPT last season ranked third at WR) and he's also a plus contributor as a rusher (282 yards and three TDs on 31 career carries). Perhaps Reed will make a Year 3 leap, but he's yet to deliver a top-25 fantasy season (PPG) after his 40th-place finish in 2024 and now has to compete with rookies Matthew Golden and Savion Williams for work. He has the look of a low-ceiling flex."

Efficiency was an issue (outside of the top 35 in QBR, YPA and completion %) and he took a league-high 68 sacks, but he got experience (QB2 in dropbacks), avoided INTs (seven) and added value with his legs (seventh at QB in carries, rush yards and YPC). With Johnson designing the offense, a much-improved interior offensive line and a good supporting cast led by DJ Moore, Rome Odunze, Colston Loveland and Luther Burden III, Williams has no excuses as he enters a critical Year 2.

He averaged 14.6 fantasy PPG (16.8 in the six games he played in full), which was a far cry from the 20.2 (fifth highest) he averaged in 2023. Prescott has now missed multiple games in three of the past five seasons, though he has also been a top-8 fantasy QB (PPG) three times during the span. Adding George Pickens to a supporting cast that also includes CeeDee Lamb and Jake Ferguson is helpful, but because of the concerning dip in rushing, the 10-year vet is best viewed as fringe QB1."

Allen is now 33-years-old (ancient for an NFL receiver) and hasn't played a full regular season since 2019. He's no longer a fantasy WR1 (he finished 34th in PPG last season), but he has a real shot to trail only Ladd McConkey in targets in a solid Los Angeles offense.

His 13.3 fantasy PPG ranked 34th among WRs and he hit the 15-point mark in four of his six games. One of the game's top deep threats and a contributor as a rusher and returner, Shaheed very well could find his way to weekly fantasy relevance in a similar way as Deebo Samuel Sr., albeit with more vertical work. Of course, he's yet to show that level of production over a full season and he'll need to fend off Chris Olave, Alvin Kamara and now Brandin Cooks for work in an offense that will have rookie QB Tyler Shough under center. Shaheed is a fine late-round lottery ticket."

The Ohio State product was primarily a slot (73%), short-range (8.6 aDOT) target in college, but was productive, catching 72% of his targets and posting a strong 2.64 YPRR. Also a rushing and return threat, Egbuka will have a role right out of the gate, but just how sizable it is will depend on the health of Chris Godwin (ankle). And even if Godwin is sidelined, Mike Evans and second-year Jalen McMillan will be major offensive factors. Egbuka is a terrific dynasty hold, but he's only worth a late flier in 2025 leagues."

He played 85% of Green Bay's offensive snaps in 2024 and while his volume was underwhelming (18th among TEs in targets and receptions), he was productive (seventh in yards and fourth in touchdowns).

After finding the end zone in Weeks 1 and 2, he went without a TD or a fantasy point total above 14.8 the rest of the season. He's still in his prime at age 26, but Etienne's efficiency has been weak two seasons in a row and he's no longer a lock for lead-back duties, with Tank Bigsby ticketed for a big role and fourth-round rookie Bhayshul Tuten now in the mix.

Spears saw a late-season boost in usage and scored four TDs in a two-game stretch, but he averaged 7.6 touches and 5.7 fantasy points per game prior to that, and Pollard is still atop the depth chart. Perhaps Spears will carry his late-season momentum into 2025, but odds are he'll remain a moderately-used receiving complement to Pollard. He's worth no more than a bench spot."

Bigsby scored three TDs to Etienne's zero, but averaged only 7.8 fantasy PPG due to major receiving limitations (18 yards on seven targets during the span). This committee now includes rookie Bhayshul Tuten and is setting up to be a fantasy nightmare, though perhaps new coach Liam Coen can make some magic happen, as he did with Bucky Irving and Rachaad White in Tampa Bay last season.

The 2024 third overall pick took over as New England's starter in Week 6 and went on to play the bulk of the snaps in 10 games. Though he wasn't a starting option in fantasy (his one top-10 outing came in Week 7), he played well (17th in QBR) and provided a respectable floor, averaging 16.4 fantasy PPG (that would've ranked 15th over the full season). New coach Mike Vrabel operated run-heavy offenses all six seasons in Tennessee, which may limit Maye's upside, but that could mostly be offset by Maye's rushing ability (he ranked ninth in yards, second in YPC and fifth in scrambles among QBs as a rookie). Especially if Stefon Diggs (ACL) will be ready to go in Week 1, Maye will make for an excellent late-round flier with upside."

The 2020 first-round pick played well last season (sixth in QBR) despite battling injury issues, but he wasn't much of a fantasy option. He came out strong with a pair of top-3 fantasy outings in his first four games, but had no additional weekly finishes better than 10th for the season. Love was a nonfactor with his legs (83 rushing yards in 15 games) and, after totaling 15 pass TDs in his first five games, threw only 10 in his final 10 outings. Green Bay did score an unusually high percentage of its offensive TDs on the ground (46%, the second highest for a Matt LaFleur offense), but that may not change with Josh Jacobs back in 2025. Love ran more in 2023 and was a solid fantasy starter, so, especially with a better supporting cast led by first-round WR Matthew Golden, there's hope for a rebound, but it is safer to view him as a QB2."

With Ben Johnson leading the offense, Goff has finished sixth or better in passing yards and TDs each of the last three seasons, but he adds almost nothing with his legs (150 yards and two TDs total during the three seasons). Even during a productive 2024, Goff was inconsistent, as he posted eight top-10 fantasy weeks but was 17th or worse the other nine weeks. Especially with Johnson off to Chicago, Goff is likely to see some regression in key efficiency categories (his 72% completion rate and 8.6 YPA last season were way above his previous career highs) and, coupled with his lack of rushing, he has a very low fantasy ceiling. Goff will remain a productive passer, but he's no more than a QB2 with occasional streaming appeal."

Sampson's fantasy outlook is less than ideal, as second-round rookie Quinshon Judkins is the team's short- and long-term lead back, with Jerome Ford possibly a factor in 2025 as well. Sampson is barely worth late-round consideration, but is a fine dynasty hold."

Charbonnet is a young (24), high-pedigree (second-round) back who has played well, so perhaps new OC Klint Kubiak will give him more run. It is best to treat him as an elite insurance bench hold."

His season ended the following week, but was enough to provide optimism about his future.

He had a midseason stretch of four straight top-10 fantasy outings, but otherwise had one weekly finish better than 17th (eighth in Week 1). During the 11 weeks he was active, Tagovailoa averaged 16.5 fantasy PPG (14th best). He remains a nonfactor with his legs (below 75 yards three straight seasons, with zero rush TDs during the span), which is why he's never finished a season better than 10th in fantasy PPG. A decent supporting cast led by Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle and De'Von Achane keeps Tagovailoa in the weekly streaming mix, but he has a low ceiling due to the limited rushing output."

He opened the season with two seventh-place fantasy weeks in his first four games, but proceeded to finish 14th or worse each of the 13 remaining weeks. He reached 20 fantasy points only once (Week 4). Still only 23, Stroud is still on the ascent, but he'll need to produce more through the air in order to offset mild-to-moderate rushing contributions.

Harris also figures to be very limited as a receiver, as Jim Harbaugh and Greg Roman have a long history of low RB usage in the pass game, in addition to the fact Harris has finished outside the top 20 RBs in targets each of the past two seasons. Harris has ranked in the 20-to-30 range in fantasy PPG each of the past three seasons, but even if he splits carries with Hampton, he'll be hard-pressed to produce consistent flex numbers."

He dominated the combine, posting RB-best marks in the 40 (4.32), speed score (118) and vertical (40.5). Tuten is fast, tough and has three-down ability, though his Year 1 opportunity is unclear with Travis Etienne Jr. and Tank Bigsby also on the depth chart. That could lead to a limited early-season role, but the uncertainty also allows him a chance to steal lead-back duties.

Despite handling a hefty 25% target share (which helped him to top-10 finishes in both targets and receptions), Robinson finished outside the top 40 receivers in yardage and fantasy PPG due to a WR-low 4.9 aDOT and horrific 5.0 YPT. The 24-year-old is strictly a short-area option and, though having Russell Wilson (and perhaps Jaxson Dart) under center will help, Robinson is a very low-ceiling PPR depth receiver."

The 25-year-old is a capable situational deep threat (he's ranked top 12 in aDOT two years in a row), but he's a good bet for touchdown regression to the mean (4.6 expected TDs last season) and his usage is too volatile to allow weekly flex consideration."

Of course, Godwin was out during that stretch and, even if he misses some time in 2025, the team drafted Emeka Egbuka in the first round of April's draft. Consistent fantasy production will be hard for McMillan to find with Evans, Godwin and Egbuka in the mix, so he'll be only a deep-league flex option if Godwin is sidelined.

Granted it was a small sample, but Shipley wasn't overly effective (2.7 YPC), which aligns with his underwhelming collegiate efficiency. Still, with Gainwell now in Pittsburgh, Shipley has an opportunity to lock down one of the league's best insurance jobs.

The 2023 third-round pick was expected to make a Year 2 leap last season, but instead posted a receiving line (47-548-4) that was very similar to that of his rookie campaign (38-565-3) and in three more games. The 25-year-old's best season may be ahead of him, but he's going to be hard-pressed for consistent targets and fantasy output in an offense that features Harrison, Trey McBride and James Conner, and scores a substantial chunk of its touchdowns on the ground. Wilson's only path to the flex discussion will be if Harrison misses time, so he's not worth much late-round consideration."

Bryant peaked with a 54-984-10 receiving line in 2024.

On the plus side, he saw a huge spike in work late last season, producing 199 yards on 23 touches during Weeks 15-17 (his 28 targets ranked first and 43.9 fantasy points second among TEs during the span). There aren't many mouths to feed in Tennessee, so it's possible the 25-year-old can carry that momentum into 2025, but he'll need decent play from rookie QB Cam Ward.

Ertz is now 34 years old and has added competition for targets with Deebo Samuel Sr. in town and Ben Sinnott entering Year 2, so a step back in production is probable, but he'll continue to benefit from playing a role in a Jayden Daniels-led offense.

Smith is now reunited with Arthur Smith, which isn't necisarily a good thing, as averaged single-digit fantay points during three prior seasons with Smith calling the plays. Pittsburgh is shaky at wideout, so Smith will play plenty, but his target ceiling is much lower with Pat Freiermuth also in the mix. Smith is best valued as a mid-to-back-end TE2."

The addition of first-round S Malaki Starks boosts their secondary, and the Ravens have a generally sound schedule including two games each against the Browns and Steelers. Watch out for that tough opening-week matchup (@BUF), however."

Is it enough to propel the D/ST into fantasy relevance? We'll see, but the Patriots do have one of the game's softest schedules, especially early in the season (LV, @MIA, PIT, CAR, @BUF, @NO, @TEN, CLE first eight games)."

Hutchinson's healthy return will help, but the Lions' schedule is a doozy, with six games against projected top-eight offenses.

Last season, he missed nine games and, while he did have a few solid outings (12-plus points three weeks in a row), he averaged a career-low 8.9 PPG on the season. With Tank Dell (knee) in doubt for 2025, Kirk will compete with rookies Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel for No. 2 receiver duties opposite Nico Collins, and he figures to work as the team's primary slot receiver. There's not much upside here (he's cleared six TDs once in his career), so Kirk should be viewed as no more than a late-round pick."

The 25-year-old has minimal upside (zero top-10 fantasy outings last season) and substantial competition for targets, with rookies Matthew Golden and Savion Williams joining a WR group that also includes Jayden Reed, Dontayvion Wicks and eventually Christian Watson (ACL recovery). Add in an offensive scheme that leans heavily on Josh Jacobs near the goal line and Doubs' inconsistent usage and limited upside makes him no more than a bench option in fantasy."

Pacheco returned in Week 13 and then neither were viable fantasy options from that point forward, as they were near even in snaps, carries and targets, with Samaje Perine also in the mix as a passing-down specialist.

The former No. 1 overall pick has yet to deliver a top-10 fantasy campaign (PPG) and that's despite finishing each of his first three NFL seasons in the top 10 among QBs in pass attempts, carries and rush yards. Lawrence is a solid player who adds just enough with his arm and legs to hang in the QB2 mix. His ceiling has obviously been low, but perhaps the presence of Brian Thomas Jr., Travis Hunter and new head coach Liam Coen can get him to the next level. He's a fine but unspectacular late-round pick."

He threw for 200-plus yards and one INT in all three, totaling three passing TDs during the stretch. Though he did produce one rushing TD, he was (as expected) a nonfactor with his legs, totaling 11 yards on seven carries. Penix will benefit from a very good supporting cast led by Drake London and Bijan Robinson, but he'll be working in an offense that was third-run-heaviest in the league last season and he's unlikely to add much (if any) value with his legs. Penix should be viewed as no more than a late-round lottery ticket."

The 2023 sixth-round pick earned a significant offensive role early in his rookie season and took a slight leap forward last season, hitting career-best marks in targets, catches, yardage and TDs. One of the league's smallest receivers at 5-foot-8, 179 pounds, Douglas primarily works as a short-area slot receiver, which has severely limited his yardage, TDs and, of course, fantasy output. The 24-year-old has yet to deliver a top-55 fantasy campaign (PPG) and is a candidate for a lesser role in 2025 with Stefon Diggs and Kyle Williams in the mix on what is likely to be a run-first offense under Mike Vrabel. Douglas has minimal late-round appeal."

Things went very poorly in the final two stops, as he totaled three catches in five games. Johnson enters his age-29 season set to compete with Cedric Tillman for No. 2 WR duties behind Jerry Jeudy in an offense that has major question marks at quarterback. It's possible he could find his way back into the flex discussion (he finished in the top 40 in PPG four straight seasons from 2020 to 2023), but it's more likely his days of fantasy relevance are over."

That led to one big fantasy outing (12-11-73-0 in Week 15), but he otherwise averaged 6.9 fantasy PPG and failed to clear 12.4 points in any of the other seven games. Perhaps Strange gets to another level in Year 3, but, especially with Brian Thomas Jr. and Travis Hunter set to be featured, the 2023 second-round pick seems likely to settle in as a low-ceiling TE2."

Taylor is one of the youngest (21) tight ends in this class and may require some development, but he's also well positioned for a sizable Year 1 role with Jeremy Ruckert as his top competition for the starting job, not to mention the Jets' lack of depth at wide receiver. It wouldn't be a shock if Taylor finished 2025 second to only Garrett Wilson in targets, so even in what will be a low-volume passing game with Justin Fields under center, Taylor is a fine late-round dart throw in deeper leagues."

Hopkins' days as a lineup lock are over and that's especially the case at 33-years-old in a run-friendly Baltimore offense that spreads the ball around quite a bit.

Things improved under a new coaching staff in Year 2, with Johnston doubling his rookie-season target share (from 11% to 22%) and scoring eight TDs (12th most among receivers). His production was inconsistent, however, as 43% of his fantasy points came in three games and he had seven single-digit outings. He finished 39th or lower in snaps, routes, targets, catches, yards and fantasy PPG, so, if he's going to join the WR3/flex discussion, he'll need a volume boost in order to offset TD regression to the mean (4.8 xTD). That boost is unlikely, as he'll now have to battle Keenan Allen and rookie Tre Harris for work behind Ladd McConkey. Johnston is barely worth a late flier."

Now more than a year removed from the knee injury, perhaps Chubb can get back on track in 2025, but that will be a tough road at age 29 and without a clear path to consistent usage.

One concern here is that the TD output is unsustainable, as Freiermuth ranked 20th in expected TDs (3.1, which aligned with where he was when he scored two TDs in both 2022 and 2023) and had a career-low two end zone targets. Another concern is the acquisition of Jonnu Smith, who even in an offense short on WR depth, is sure to cut into Freiermuth's target share. The arrival of Aaron Rodgers helps his cause a bit, and he may settle in second in target priority behind DK Metcalf, but there's not much of a ceiling here. Freiermuth is a mid-to-back-end TE2."

He became a nonfactor near the goal line, totaling two end zone targets and two TDs, both of which are his fewest since taking on a regular offensive role in 2020. His history suggests a return to the fringe-TE1 mix is possible, and he could see a slight boost in targets with Christian Kirk and a pair of rookies set to replace Stefon Diggs (free agency) and Tank Dell (knee), but he also could lose work to second-year TE Cade Stover.

He has evolved into a solid, albeit conservative passer who adds some value with his legs.

            "outlook_2025": "Richardson enters his third NFL season as one of the trickiest wild cards in fantasy. On one hand, the 2023 No. 4 overall pick has a ton of upside; he ranked no lower than sixth among QBs in carries, rush yards and rush TDs last season despite playing only 10 full games, while also pacing the position in average depth of throw and yards per completion. That led to four games with 20-plus fantasy points. On the other hand, Richardson's poor passing may land him on the bench. He had fewer than 15 fantasy points in his other six outings, threw 12 INTs on the season (fourth most) and his 48% completion percentage ranked last. In total, he averaged 15.8 fantasy PPG in the 10 games, which would've ranked 15th over the full season. Richardson is no longer a lock to start with Daniel Jones in the mix, but his elite rushing ability and aggressive passing style will put him on the weekly QB1 radar when he's in the lineup."

That's a big letdown for a former third-round pick, and though a variety of injuries have been a culprit, he has yet to even lock down clear backup duties to Alvin Kamara when healthy. The good news is he's young (23), capable as both a rusher and receiver and should have a fresh start under a new coaching staff led by Kellen Moore. Kamara remains the lead back in New Orleans, but he turns 30 this year, which opens to the door for Miller to be a valuable insurance back if he can fend off Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Devin Neal for No. 2 duties. Miller is a fine late-round lottery ticket."

Dowdle found the end zone only five times in Dallas' struggling offense, however, which limited him to a 24th-place finish in fantasy points per game. The 27-year-old showed well in a tough situation, but he'll enter 2025 as a clear backup to Chuba Hubbard, with rookie Trevor Etienne also a threat for work. Dowdle has some deep-league insurance appeal, though he would max out as a RB2/flex even if called on to start."

He was targeted often when on the field (54 targets on 193 routes), but his vertical role, coupled with poor QB play (league-high 41% off target rate), led to a position-worst 43% catch rate and zero TDs. Mitchell's second-round pedigree places him on the breakout radar, but his hands will be full overcoming the team's WR depth (all three of Pittman, Pierce and Downs are back) and ongoing QB question marks. Mitchell is no more than a late-round lottery ticket."

Perhaps that proves he still has some gas left in the tank, but now 28 years old and not much of a contributor as a pass catcher, it's unlikely Sanders will find his way to the fantasy radar. He'll battle Javonte Williams and rookie Jaydon Blue for work in Dallas, and is only worth a late flier in deep leagues."

The 2018 sixth-round pick spent his first six seasons as a bench/situational player for four different teams prior to enjoying a mini-breakout in 2024. Operating as Atlanta's No. 3 receiver, McCloud set career-best marks in targets, catches and yardage. He was able to manage only a 59th-place finish in fantasy PPG, however, as he found the end zone once and, incredibly, now has only three touchdowns on 177 career touches. The 28-year-old remains behind Drake London and Darnell Mooney on the Atlanta depth chart. He has minimal upside and is worth a late flier only in the deepest of leagues."

Atwell has yet to post a top-60 fantasy campaign and, after failing to find the end zone in 2024, he has a total of five scores in 54 career games. Sean McVay has said that he will deploy Atwell more often moving forward, but the undersized 25-year-old remains well behind Puka Nacua and Davante Adams in terms of target priority.

Even when healthy, the 2022 second-round pick has failed to live up to his pedigree, having yet to produce a top-30 fantasy campaign. He's all but settled in as a situational deep threat, ranking second in aDOT each of the last two seasons. On the plus side, Watson ranked second among receivers in YPT (11.5) and YPR (21.4) last season, which allowed a career-high 620 receiving yards. Perhaps a healthy Watson will eventually find his way back to fantasy relevance, but the 26-year-old is well off the radar in 2025."

The 2023 UDFA reached a career high with 137 touches in 2024, but he's yet to play more than 42% of the snaps in a single game. That's no surprise and unlikely to change considering his 5-foot-8, 187-pound frame. Denver did take a look at him in an expanded role during his final four games of 2024 (10-plus touches in all four, including a career-high 18 in Week 18), but he failed to reach double-digit fantasy points in any of them, nor did he clear 12.6 points in any of his 16 games last season. The 24-year-old has some juice, but he's likely to remain a depth back behind newcomers J.K. Dobbins and RJ Henry and has minimal fantasy value."

Once the Jets acquired Davante Adams, however, Lazard's usage plummeted and he managed an 11-176-1 line (5.8 PPG) in his final six games. Lazard has a shot at No. 2 WR duties opposite Garrett Wilson this season, but with Rodgers out and dual-threat Justin Fields in at quarterback, there's almost no upside here.

He also led this class in YPR, YPT, RAC and adjusted catch rate for his career. Incredibly, Arroyo is charted as having zero career drops. The important context here is that Arroyo was a rarely used target (61 in 34 games, 47 of which came in 2024). He has long-term fantasy upside, but will open his career battling second-year A.J. Barner for work. Arroyo is the better pass-catching prospect of the two, so he's a sleeper to consider in the late rounds of deep leagues."

Gesicki was boom/bust (four games with 14-plus points, but 11 with 9 points or fewer), but he peaked late with position-best marks in targets (22), catches (18), receiving yards (154) and fantasy points (33.4) during Weeks 17 and 18. Gesicki is a situational player and will need to fend off newcomer Noah Fant, but he will benefit from Joe Burrow and the league's pass-heaviest offense. He's a bench option in deep leagues."

Unsurprisingly, he didn't play much of a role initially, but he seemed back to his usual self in the playoff game against the Eagles, posting a 7-54-1 receiving line on 10 targets. Higbee has enjoyed spurts of fantasy relevance at times throughout his career, but he's never finished better than 10th in PPG, and even that was way back in 2019. The 32-year-old will settle in no higher than third in target priority behind Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, so he's not worth your attention in the late rounds."

After posting zero weekly finishes better than ninth in his prior most recent full season (2022), he managed one finish better than eighth in 2024. He's still able to put up passing numbers (top 8 in attempts, yards and TDs last season), but is a nonfactor with his legs (107 rushing yards last season was actually his highest since 2020). In Pittsburgh, Rodgers will be working in Arthur Smith's run-heavy scheme with a shaky supporting cast. He's well off the fantasy radar."

Following Derek Carr's shocking retirement in May, Shough is likely to slide in as the Saints' starting quarterback. Even if he wins that job and despite a decent WR trio (Chris Olave, Rashid Shaheed, Brandin Cooks), Shough is unlikely to emerge as a consistent fantasy option in an offense that is expected to struggle in 2025. Shough should only be selected late in superflex leagues."

He did find the end zone six times in 16 games, but a lack of volume allowed him only 6.5 fantasy PPG after the season opener. Playing behind (or alongside) Mark Andrews the past three years, Likely has yet to finish a season among the top 20 tight ends in snaps, routes, targets, catches or yardage. His 20th-place finish in fantasy PPG last season was a career best. Perhaps Likely's best days are ahead of him, but consistent fantasy value is a long shot as long as Andrews is on the roster.

Hill is a long shot to play in 2025, though the team will be in better shape at wide receiver with a healthy Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed, as well as newcomer Brandin Cooks.

He flashed a bit while playing an expanded role when Tommy Tremble was sidelined for four games near midseason (5.0 targets and 10.9 fantasy points per game), but the rookie was limited to a situational role in the 11 games Tremble was active (2.0 targets and 2.6 PPG). Sanders will be a candidate for more work in his second season, but he's still very young (22) and will continue to share work with Tremble. The 2024 fourth-round pick is only worth a late flier in deeper leagues."

He finished either exactly 16th or 18th in fantasy points all four years and was in the 18th-to-23rd range on a per-game basis each year. Conklin has proven reliable (he's missed two games in his career) but he's not targeted quite enough, nor does he score enough touchdowns (11 in seven seasons) to allow starter-level production in fantasy. Conklin may lead the Chargers' TE room in targets, but with Will Dissly also in the mix, he's no more than a fringe TE2."

He finished one season better than 15th in fantasy PPG and that eighth-place finish in 2022 was primarily a product of big-time rushing (120-708-7). The 28-year-old isn't going to move the needle as a passer, but if he wins the Colts' gig, he could land on the streaming radar due to his legs (60-plus carries in four of the last five seasons).

He's an older prospect and undersized, but adds some value with his legs (career 311-1,895-33 line).

The team likely still views Sinnott as its tight end of the future, but he's not the tight end of the present, as Ertz was signed to an extension during the offseason and Bates is also back.

He adds a bit with his legs (117-687-8 line during his time at Colorado), which will help his fantasy stock if he can beat out the likes of Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett and third-round rookie Dillon Gabriel for Cleveland's starting gig. Sanders is worth drafting only in dynasty and superflex."

Instead, he finished 30th in QBR, paced the NFL with 16 INTs and continued to add nothing with his legs (zero yards on 23 carries). Cousins managed three weekly finishes better than 15th prior to being benched for Michael Penix Jr. in Week 16. Perhaps Cousins will bounce back now that he's more than one year removed from Achilles surgery, but considering he's now 37 years old, it's unlikely he'll find his way back into the QB1 mix."

There are accuracy concerns, but he has a good arm and terrific speed and agility, having posted elite rushing numbers last season (145-906-20).

The 2019 third-round pick flirted with top-12 fantasy output in the two years prior to Kincaid's arrival, but has since seen a severe dip in usage, plummeting to career-low marks in targets (33), touchdowns (one) and fantasy PPG (3.7) last season. That was despite Kincaid missing three games (Knox averaged 5.7 PPG those weeks). In total, Knox had zero double-digit fantasy outings in 2024 and his last game over 10.2 points was Week 16 of 2022. Even if Kincaid misses time, 28-year-old Knox won't be a starting option in fantasy."

He finished in the top 10 among TEs in all key categories that season, but plummeted to outside the top 20 in targets, catches, yards and fantasy points in 2024. In what was a bit of a bizarre season, Kmet appeared in all 17 games, paced all tight ends in snaps, finished fifth in routes and led the position with an 84% catch rate, but ended up 27th in fantasy PPG. He had two games with double-digit targets but three with zero. The 26-year-old's fantasy stock took a massive hit in April when Chicago spent its first-round pick on Colston Loveland. No longer positioned for more than the occasional target or two, Kmet is well off the fantasy radar."

Musgrave missed 10 more games last season and was unproductive when active, playing 31% of the snaps and totaling 10 targets in seven outings.

This will be the journeyman's fifth team in seven seasons and he made multiple starts at each of his prior homes (Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Las Vegas). Minshew has yet to play a full regular season and his best fantasy campaign was a 19th-place finish in 2019 (he was 13th on a per-game basis in 2020, but only appeared in nine games). Minshew played in 10 games with the Raiders last season, but threw more INTs (10) than touchdowns (nine) and eventually lost his starting job to Aidan O'Connell. Minshew is well off the fantasy radar and would only join the QB2 conversation if Mahomes were to miss time."

He's primarily been a backup and spot-starter over the past five seasons, but he made seven straight starts in relief of injured Deshaun Watson last season. The result was what you expect from Winston, as he had his share of big plays (both good and bad) and ended up with 12 pass TDs and 12 INTs. Winston is likely to back up Russell Wilson and perhaps rookie Jaxson Dart this season. If called upon to start, he may add some big-play opportunities for the team's pass catchers, but will be no more than a desperation streaming option in deep leagues."

That didn't slow him from a huge workload at Stanford, as he handled a 32% target share and 47% air yard share (second highest in this class) last season. His efficiency was mostly below average, but there's potential here. Ayomanor will begin his career behind Calvin Ridley, Tyler Lockett and perhaps Van Jefferson, Treylon Burks and fellow rookie Chimere Dike. Ayomanor is only worth drafting in dynasty."

He's a perimeter receiver who primarily works in the short area and lived on hook routes at Utah State. Even in a good Chiefs offense, Royals is a long shot for 2025 fantasy value, as he'll be behind Xavier Worthy, Rashee Rice, Hollywood Brown and perhaps JuJu Smith-Schuster on the depth chart.

He's generally been a depth receiver, but there were seven games last season in which he played at least 70% of the offensive snaps (Romeo Doubs and/or Christian Watson were sidelined those weeks). Wicks handled a healthy 22% target share (6.6 per game), but wasn't overly productive. After a strong 5-78-2 showing on 13 targets (24.8 fantasy points) in Week 4, he failed to clear seven targets, five receptions, 49 yards or 9.9 fantasy points in any of the other six outings. Even with Christian Watson likely to miss all or most of 2025, Wicks will have his hands full finding reps with Matthew Golden, Doubs, Jayden Reed and Savion Williams also on the roster. Wicks isn't worth drafting."

In addition to his 87 targets, Williams posted a 51-322-6 rushing line in 2024. He ran a strong 4.48 40 and has the potential to emerge as a multi-faceted (rusher, receiver, returner) asset in the pros. Williams' path to consistent targets in 2025 is tricky, as Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed and fellow rookie Matthew Golden headline the depth chart. He's only worth a late-round flier, but is a good dynasty hold."

He is the only WR in this class who had zero recorded drops during his Division I tenure, though his 1.48 YPRR while at Arkansas is lowest among all WRs in this rookie class. He showed well at the combine, though, including a 4.43 40 at 214 pounds. TeSlaa will operate as a depth receiver behind Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams and perhaps Tim Patrick and Kalif Raymond this season. He's only worth rostering in dynasty."

The Miami product is a big, power back who is effective as a rusher -- his 4.48 YAC last season trailed only Ashton Jeanty, and the same goes for his 3.88 career rate -- but he may not do much as a receiver in the pros. Martinez will begin his career buried behind Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet, so he's well off the fantasy radar."
