# Draft Not Found Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Users were getting a "Draft not found" error when trying to draft players. The error appeared in the server logs as:
```
📥 Draft player request: 26 for draft 1755867655866
⚠️ Draft not found: 1755867655866
```

## Root Cause
The issue was that the server was missing a `join-draft` event handler. When users tried to join an existing draft or when the client tried to transition from lobby to draft view, there was no mechanism to:

1. **Join the draft room**: The client needed to join the specific draft room to receive updates
2. **Get current draft state**: The client needed to receive the current draft state when joining
3. **Handle draft transitions**: When moving from lobby to draft view, the client needed to properly join the draft

## The Fix

### 1. Added Missing `join-draft` Handler (Server)
**File**: `server/index.js`

Added a new event handler that:
- Validates the draft ID
- Joins the client to the draft room
- Sends the current draft state to the client
- Sends participants and team assignments if available

```javascript
// Join draft (get current draft state)
socket.on('join-draft', (data) => {
  const { draftId } = data;
  
  if (!draftId) {
    console.log('⚠️ No draftId provided for join-draft request');
    socket.emit('draft-error', { message: 'No draft ID provided' });
    return;
  }
  
  console.log(`📥 Join draft request for draft ${draftId}`);
  
  // Join the draft room
  socket.join(`draft-${draftId}`);
  
  // Get the current draft state
  const draftState = activeDrafts.get(draftId);
  
  if (!draftState) {
    console.log('⚠️ Draft not found:', draftId);
    socket.emit('draft-error', { message: 'Draft not found' });
    return;
  }
  
  console.log(`✅ Sending draft state for draft ${draftId}`);
  
  // Send the current draft state to the client
  socket.emit('draft-state', draftState);
  
  // Also send current participants if available
  const participants = draftParticipants.get(draftId);
  if (participants) {
    const participantsList = Array.from(participants.values());
    socket.emit('participants-update', participantsList);
  }
  
  // Send team assignments if available
  const assignments = draftTeamAssignments.get(draftId);
  if (assignments) {
    socket.emit('team-assignments-update', assignments);
  }
});
```

### 2. Enhanced Client Draft Transition Logic (Client)
**File**: `client/src/App.jsx`

Modified the `handleStartDraft` function to detect when joining an existing draft vs starting a new one:

```javascript
const handleStartDraft = (config) => {
  // Check if this is joining an existing draft vs starting a new one
  const isJoiningExistingDraft = draftState?.isDraftStarted || draftState?.status === 'in_progress';
  
  if (isJoiningExistingDraft) {
    console.log('🏈 Joining existing draft - emitting join-draft event');
    
    // Validation checks for joining existing draft
    if (!socket) {
      console.error('❌ Cannot join draft: Socket not available');
      alert('❌ Connection Error: Unable to connect to server. Please refresh the page and try again.');
      return;
    }
    
    if (!socket.connected) {
      console.error('❌ Cannot join draft: Socket not connected');
      alert('❌ Connection Error: Lost connection to server. Please refresh the page and try again.');
      return;
    }
    
    if (!config?.id) {
      console.error('❌ Cannot join draft: No draft ID provided');
      alert('❌ Error: Draft ID is missing. Please try again.');
      return;
    }
    
    try {
      console.log('📥 Emitting join-draft event for draft:', config.id);
      socket.emit('join-draft', { draftId: config.id });
      console.log('✅ join-draft event emitted successfully');
      
      // Transition to draft view
      setAppView('draft');
      
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('💥 Error emitting join-draft event:', error);
      alert('❌ Error: Failed to join draft. Please try again.');
    }
    
    return;
  }
  
  // ... rest of the function for starting new drafts
};
```

## How It Works

1. **When a user clicks "Start Draft" or "Enter Live Draft"**:
   - The client checks if the draft is already in progress
   - If it is, it emits a `join-draft` event with the draft ID
   - If it's a new draft, it emits a `start-draft` event

2. **When the server receives `join-draft`**:
   - It validates the draft ID
   - It joins the client to the draft room
   - It sends the current draft state to the client
   - It sends participants and team assignments

3. **When the client receives `draft-state`**:
   - It updates the local draft state
   - It transitions to the draft view
   - It can now properly draft players

## Testing

The fix has been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Non-existent drafts return proper error messages
- ✅ Existing drafts can be joined successfully
- ✅ Draft state is properly received when joining
- ✅ Players can be drafted after joining

## Impact

This fix resolves the "Draft not found" error and ensures that:
- Users can properly join existing drafts
- The draft state is correctly synchronized between client and server
- Player drafting functionality works as expected
- The transition from lobby to draft view works smoothly

## Files Modified

1. **server/index.js**: Added `join-draft` event handler
2. **client/src/App.jsx**: Enhanced `handleStartDraft` function to handle existing drafts

The fix ensures that the client-server communication is properly established when joining drafts, preventing the "Draft not found" errors that were occurring when trying to draft players.
